Shortly after the Big Apple case was announced, Mayor Bill de Blasio released a statement saying authorities are “fully prepared to respond” to the development.
“From the beginning, we have said it was a matter of when, not if there would be a positive case of coronavirus in New York,” the mayor said.
“Our health authorities have been in a state of high alert for weeks, and are fully prepared to respond,” the statement said. “We will continue to ensure New Yorkers have the facts and resources they need to protect themselves.”
New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson tweeted that “this is no cause to panic.”
The council will hold a hearing on Thursday to find out how the Big Apple is prepared for the outbreak, Johnson said.
Governor Andrew Cuomo on Sunday evening announced the first case of the deadly virus in the state — a woman in her late 30s who recently traveled to Iran.
She is being isolated and monitored at home in Manhattan.
The patient isn’t sick enough to be hospitalized, according to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
City health officials have identified close contacts of the woman who may have been exposed “and will take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said in a statement.
The Health Department didn’t say how many people the patient was in contact with.
“Despite this development, New Yorkers remain at low risk for contracting COVID-19,” Barbot said.
“As we confront this emerging outbreak, we need to separate facts from fear, and guard against stigma and panic.”
Nine people have tested negative for the virus in the Big Apple, with one test still pending as of Sunday night."
1,Coronavirus taking a toll on Chinese restaurants in New York,https://nypost.com/2020/03/01/coronavirus-taking-a-toll-on-chinese-restaurants-in-new-york/,2020-03-01 00:00:00,"Even the Big Apple’s most beloved Chinese restaurants are in critical condition as the coronavirus keeps customers at bay.
Restaurant owners, the people who work for them and city lawmakers say business at Chinese-owned establishments has plummeted by as much as 60 percent as the global pandemic spreads. Some restaurants in Queens have closed, possibly for good, sources said.
“It’s been terrible for business,” said Thomas Lo, a co-owner of Spy C Cuisine of Forest Hills, Queens, which opened in 2018 and garnered a coveted spot in this year’s Michelin Guide. “We’ve had a steady increase in business since we opened, and then coronavirus hit,” said Lo, who is an anesthesiologist by day and a chef by night.
“None of our food comes from China, but that doesn’t matter to diners. I don’t know what motivated the scare. A lot of it is misinformation,” said Lo, who says business at Spy C is down more than 50 percent from a month ago.
“It’s killed a lot of restaurants and others are just getting by, trying to survive. “A lot of the large Chinese restaurants in Flushing are now closed — for renovations, they say, but it’s unlikely they’ll reopen,” said Lo. “Chinatown was also really hit. It’s a lot slower. All you have to do is walk around to notice it.”
Councilmember Peter Koo of Queens has called on Mayor Bill de Blasio to offer a helping hand in light of Hizzoner’s recent vow to “provide small businesses the support they need to survive.”
“The city should do something like lower taxes,” Koo said. “Some restaurants have even closed. They have no business and even the ones that are open have more staff than diners. These are big spaces with huge overhead.”
Koo is counting on the mayor’s initiative, unveiled earlier this month during his state of the city address, to help local businesses stay afloat amid rising rents and labor costs. “We must make New York City easier to afford, protect the mom-and-pop businesses that make New York New York, and hand this city back to the people who make it so great,” de Blasio announced at the time.
The mayor’s office didn’t return a request for comment. But sources say de Blasio made a show of confidence in struggling Chinese restaurants on Thursday by attending a Chinese New Year event at Jing Fong, the city’s largest restaurant with 25,000 square feet of space and a unionized staff of 170.
But Jing Fong — an iconic Chinatown eatery famous for its traditional dim sum carts — is not faring any better than its peers, said Claudia Leo, Jing Fong’s marketing director. Events scheduled for March are down 75 percent over last year, Leo told Side Dish. In February, business was down 50 percent.
“We can’t lay off anyone but we are reducing hours so people working six days a week might now be working three or four days a week,” Leo told Side Dish.
There’s also an uptown Jing Fong on the Upper West Side that employs 30 staffers and seats 70 people. Business there was down 20 percent in February, she said.
“Business is down there too, but not as much,” Leo said. “This tells you that people are still eating out but they are staying away from Chinatown.”
Johnny Lin, owner of Four Four South Village, a popular Taiwanese beef noodle restaurant in Flushing, said his business is also hurting.
“Flushing has been hugely impacted by the coronavirus,” Lin said. “Business has been going down dramatically thanks to rumors and fear-mongering … We hope that the community and the government can encourage people to support local businesses, and of course Flushing, by alleviating the concerns people have about the virus.”
A publicist who works with top Chinese restaurants across Manhattan said some restaurant owners are still hesitant to acknowledge how bad things have gotten.
“I do have some clients that are impacted significantly, but they prefer to not talk about it. Personally, I know Chinatown and Flushing businesses are hit the hardest,” the publicist said.
Popular upscale Chinese eateries like Mr Chow, with locations in Tribeca and Midtown, Shun Lee on the Upper West Side, and Hutong near Bloomingdale’s didn’t return requests for comment at press time.
Truman Lam, the third-generation owner of Jing Fong, which was founded by his grandfather in 1972, said he had previously expected 2020 to be a bumper year following a long period of instability due to rising rent and employment costs. “We finally thought we were going to have a good year,” he lamented.
“For a business that had been around for 40 years, if this drags on for a few months, who knows if we can survive. We have some cash and we can make some cuts, but the scary thing is, there is no end in sight. The chefs are trying to cut down on staff but there is no clarity. It is hard to plan when you don’t know what will happen.”
“My grandfather would say the same thing. He came from nothing. We just have to fight and keep going and hope for the best.”"
2,Second US coronavirus death reported in Washington state,https://nypost.com/2020/03/01/second-us-coronavirus-death-reported-in-washington-state/,2020-03-01 00:00:00,"The coronavirus has claimed a second life in the US — a man in his 70s who died in a Seattle-area hospital, officials said Sunday.
The man, who had underlying health conditions, died Saturday at EvergreenHealth hospital in Kirkland, according to public health authorities in King County, Wash.
That’s the same facility where officials on Saturday identified the first person to succumb to the virus in the nation– a man in his 50s, also with underlying health conditions.
Officials announced three other confirmed cases in the county, including a woman in her 90s, a woman in her 80s and a man in his 70s.
All three were in critical condition at EvergreenHealth.
Earlier on Saturday, the county reported two other patients, both men in their 60s, in critical condition at hospitals in Seattle and Renton.
That brings the total of cases in the county to eight, including a woman who works for the US Postal Service."
3,First case of coronavirus confirmed in New York City,https://nypost.com/2020/03/01/first-case-of-coronavirus-confirmed-in-manhattan/,2020-03-01 00:00:00,"The first case of coronavirus in New York City was confirmed Sunday to be a woman in her late 30s who recently traveled to Iran, a state official said.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo released a statement Sunday night announcing the first case in the state. A source told The Post the woman lives in Manhattan.
“The patient, a woman in her late thirties, contracted the virus while traveling abroad in Iran, and is currently isolated in her home,” Cuomo said in the statement.
Despite the state’s first case of the deadly virus, Cuomo insisted, “There is no cause for surprise — this was expected.”
“As I said from the beginning, it was a matter of when, not if there would be a positive case of novel coronavirus in New York.”
As of late Sunday, there were 76 confirmed cases of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, across the US."
4,NY study-abroad students in Italy being sent home over coronavirus scare,https://nypost.com/2020/03/01/ny-study-abroad-students-in-italy-being-sent-home-over-coronavirus-scare/,2020-03-01 00:00:00,"Syracuse University student Eli Schwemler entered the courtyard of his school’s Florence, Italy, campus last week expecting a Q&A about the faraway threat of the coronavirus.
Instead, he and 341 classmates were told to pack their bags and leave the country.
“They gathered us all into a medium-sized room, looked at the entirety of us and realized it was too many people for the space. So they set up a PA system with microphones outside and led us there,” said Schwemler, 20, of Philadelphia to The Post.
“Students took their seats within the campus courtyard, and [higher-ups] finally made their statement — we had to leave the country within five days,” Schwemler said.
Panic and grief ensued, he said.
“Every student was surprised, and many cried or rushed to make hurried phone calls to their parents,’’ said the student at the upstate New York school.
“The teachers were astonished,’’ too, Schwemler said, adding that everyone was given masks at the Tuesday gathering. “Many began to sob.’’
A similar scenario has been playing out at various study-abroad campuses of American universities in Italy, where the coronavirus has sickened at least 1,128 people and killed 29 there, according to statistics from Johns Hopkins University.
Katelyn Johnson, 20, a sophomore studying at St. John’s University’s satellite campus in Rome, said that after the CDC on Friday started warning people to “avoid unnecessary travel’’ to Italy, her school, which is based in New York City, yanked the plug on its study-abroad program there, too.
Johnson said she was in Barcelona, Spain, at the time. She got the news by e-mail while at a nightclub.
“It was like, ‘Well, shoot, we’re in a different country, and now we have to get back to Italy’ ’’ to collect belongings, she told The Post.
“It was really scary, we didn’t even know if we were going to make it out of Spain.”
But she said nerves have been jittery over the deadly virus in Europe for awhile.
“I have a cough, and if I cough in public, everyone jumps and scatters, so I decided I’m going to start wearing a mask,” Johnson said last week, before getting evacuation orders.
Meanwhile, the changing nature of the situation is only adding to the students’ anxiety.
St. John’s at first sent an e-mail to the study-abroad students detailing how they would return to New York City to continue classes.
“Due to this change in guidance we are discontinuing academic programs on the Rome Campus until further notice,” the e-mail said.
But Johnson said, “Then they sent another one that said we all have to go to our homes and continue online.”
St. John’s is paying the costs of Johnson’s flight back to America and partially covering the cost of her room and board, she said.
As for Syracuse, Schwemler said, “The school didn’t have much information regarding academic credits, reimbursements or travels home.
“That information was to be figured out later. The priority was getting us to leave.’’
Syracuse students will not be allowed to return to their New York campus until after their spring break, a 14-day period consistent with the CDC’s quarantine guidelines.
They will then have the option to return and continue their studies in person and online to avoid disruption in credits.
“We believe this is absolutely necessary to reduce the risk of our students being unable to leave Italy due to Italian containment efforts,’’ wrote Steven Bennett, the school’s senior vice president for International Programs and Academic Operations, in a statement.
“We will do everything we can to minimize disruption to their academic studies and their lives.’’
For students such as Schwemler, who has already flown back to the US, the quick exit has led to feelings of an experience cut short.
“I had a really great internship’’ in Italy, he said.
Johnson, who is flying out Tuesday, said she would have preferred to brave the virus and stay in Italy.
“At this point, it just seems like I’m quarantined here or I’m quarantined there,” she said."

South Korean prosecutors have been called on to investigate the Shincheonji Church of Jesus founder Lee Man-hee and other leaders of the sect for allegedly dangerous health behavior, the New York Times reported.
The controversial religious group, which many mainstream churches consider a cult, has hundreds of members who tested positive for the coronavirus after congregants traveled to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus broke out in December, CNN reported.
Yet Duhyen Kim, a former member, claimed that attendees are not allowed to wear masks while praying because it would be “disrespectful to God.”
Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon likened the congregation’s behavior to “murder through… willful negligence” in a Facebook post, the New York Times reported.
South Korea has reported more than 3,700 cases with at least 18 deaths.
Meanwhile, there have been more than 87,000 cases across the world in 58 countries."

The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported Saturday and 386 newly confirmed cases, the majority of which are in Tehran, according to the health ministry’s spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour.
Jahanpour said the number of infections were “still inclining” as cases popped up in a number of cities, including Mashad, the home of the country’s most important Shiite shrine.
The spokesman noted that 44 cases were detected for the first time in central Markazi province.
The first cases in the country were not reported until Feb. 19, weeks after the virus broke out in Wuhan, China.
The virus, known as COVID-19, has spread to more than 87,000 people across the globe and caused around 2,900 deaths.

7,Panicked New York shoppers stock up at Costco amid coronavirus fears,https://nypost.com/2020/03/01/panicked-new-york-shoppers-stock-up-at-costco-amid-coronavirus-fears/,2020-03-01 00:00:00,"Hundreds of on-edge shoppers packed a Brooklyn Costco on Sunday to stock up on water, rice and other supplies amid fears of a coronavirus epidemic.
Panicked purchasers — many of them wearing face masks — jammed into the Sunset Park warehouse, eagerly grabbing cases of bottled water in case they’re forced to quarantine at home as the virus spreads in the US.
“The coronavirus has them panicked … they think the world is coming to an end,” the store’s manager, who would only give his name as Jerry, told The Post.
“This is great for business, though!” Jerry added, noting he expects the wholesaler could rake in over $1 million on Sunday.
Workers said they were having to constantly restock the water aisle, where shoppers were silently lined up, waiting their turn to grab bottles.
A male employee said he’d put out 48 pallets of water by early afternoon — and that they were being cleared within 10 minutes.
One 44-year-old Brooklynite, who would only give his name as Felix, said he was buying 11 cases of Poland Spring water “in case we get stuck inside.”
Another male employee said the situation was worse on Saturday.

“This is because everybody is scared about corona and they’re stocking up on water and rice,” he said.
New Yorkers weren’t the only ones in disaster prep mode over COVID-19.
A Costco in Oregon ran out of toilet paper for the first time in its history and there were reports of long lines and wild scenes at stores in other parts of the hard-hit West Coast and in Hawaii."

Ma Jianguo was ordered to death row Sunday following the double murder at a roadblock in Honghe County in the Yunnan province, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
The incident occurred Feb. 6 when one of Ma’s passengers tried to move a roadblock to allow the vehicle to pass through the checkpoint.
Ma then fatally slashed a member of the checkpoint team who whipped out a cellphone to film the incident, the report said. He also stabbed to death another person who rushed to the victim’s aid.
China has set up various checkpoints to evaluate travelers for symptoms of the deadly virus as more than 78,000 cases have sprung up in the country, mostly in the Hubei province, where the epidemic emerged in December.

Chuck Schumer called on Sunday for the coronavirus vaccine currently in the works to be fully covered by Medicare and made available to senior citizens as part of the upcoming federal legislation to fight what is possibly becoming a global pandemic.
“The novel coronavirus shows us it’s critical to make vaccines available to susceptible groups quickly. The more you dither, the more people delay, the more people say ‘I don’t know if I’ll be able to come up with the money’ the greater the danger of the coronavirus spreading.” Schumer said.
Vaccinating seniors will help deter the spread of the virus among the rest of the population, Schumer said, adding that the elderly shouldn’t have to “make the choice between shelling out and going without.”
“I think all vaccines should be covered by Medicare because they save the overall health system money. But that’s a bigger and longer fight,” Schumer said during a press conference at his Manhattan office on 3rd Avenue. “To have this vaccine covered needs to be done immediately.”
The White House asked Congress for $2.5 billion for its effort to stem the spread of the virus and treat people who may become infected, while Schumer proposed allocating $8.5 billion.
The senator said the emergency spending bill could be unveiled as early as Monday or Tuesday, and hopes that it will pass the House and Senate within the next two weeks."

Meanwhile, American said Saturday that it will suspend travel from New York and Miami to Milan through April 24, blaming a reduction in demand.
The airline said its final flight will return from Milan on Sunday.
The changes come after the US government raised its travel alert to “Level 4 — Do Not Travel” for Lombardy and Veneto in Italy “due to the level of community transmission of the virus and imposition of local quarantine procedures.”
Italy has reported more than 1,100 cases of the coronavirus with at least 29 deaths since an outbreak in Wuhan, China.

The USPS said the employee is a woman who works at a package-sorting facility in Federal Way, which is a suburb of Seattle, KING-TV reported.
The woman, whose condition is not known, is recovering while the King County facility is closed for cleaning, the report said.
She would not have handled any mail or packages, but may have been in contact with other employees, the company said, adding the agency has been advised by the county health department that the risk to other employees is low.
“No mail is delivered from the facility,” the USPS said in a statement, KIRO-TV reported. “It is sorted and transported to individual post offices, from which the parcels are delivered to customers.”
The development comes as county health officials on Sunday announced two more cases of the coronavirus, bringing the county total to six and the state’s tally to eight.
The new patients — both men in their 60s with underlying health issues — were hospitalized at Valley Medical Center in nearby Renton. One of the patients is in critical but stable condition, while the other is critical, officials said.

“Coronavirus: In addition to screening travelers ‘prior to boarding’ from certain designated high risk countries, or areas within those countries, they will also be screened when they arrive in America. Thank you!,” the president posted.
The tweet came after a Washington State resident died of the virus in the nation’s first confirmed fatal case.
At a press conference in the White House on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence said the president has directed the State Department to work with Italy and South Korea to coordinate efforts to screen travelers heading to the US.
Screenings have already been in place travelers in Iran and China — two countries hard hit by the virus.
Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller clarified the screening process.
“There is already screening for those coming into the United States for those who have been in China in the last 14 days. This will be expanded to Italy and South Korea,” she said in a statement to CNN. “Additionally, we are currently working on exit screening from South Korea, Italy, and other European Nations as needed.”"

The world’s most popular museum shut its doors to visitors while a staff meeting about the deadly virus was conducted. The virus has now spread to more than 60 countries on every continent except Antarctica.
“We are very worried because we have visitors from everywhere,” Andre Sacristin, a Louvre employee and union representative, told The Associated Press.
He added that employees also were concerned because museum workers from northern Italy — where the virus has raged — had come to the museum to collect works by Leonardo da Vinci that were loaned out.
Sacristin said concerns were expressed at the meeting that “it’s only a question of time” before the virus infects the Louvre’s 2,300 workers.
“The risk is very, very, very great,” he said.
The museum — which houses the Mona Lisa — had planned to open after the meeting between management, personnel and the staff doctor. But the Louvre later announced that it would not open at all Sunday, disgruntling a line of hopeful visitors.

France is urging people to cut back on the customary double-cheek kiss in order to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
Health Minister Olivier Véran advised the country Saturday to refrain the traditional greeting known as “la bise,” in which people give kisses, or air kisses, on both cheeks.
“The reduction in social contacts of a physical nature is advised. That includes the practice of the bise,” Veran said at a press conference.
France, which has 100 confirmed coronavirus cases and two deaths from the virus, made similar recommendations during the swine flu outbreak.
The latest guidance comes after even French President Emmanuel Macron greeted Italian Premier with a kiss on not just one, but two separate occasions, during a summit last week in Naples.
The Italian government’s special commissioner for coronavirus, Angelo Borrelli, also warned against such displays of physical contact in the country, which has seen more than 1,100 people test positive for coronavirus and at least 29 deaths.
“We have a collective social life that is very florid, very expansive. We have lots of contact, we shake hands, we kiss each other, we hug each other,” Borelli told reporters. “Maybe it is better in this period not to shake hands, and do not have too much contact, and try to be a bit less expansive, which is different from how I am.”

Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the University of Washington, said that one of the state’s recent cases appears to be linked to a Snohomish County man who was identified Jan. 19  as the country’s first coronavirus patient, the New York Times reported.
Bedford and a research team found similarities while comparing the genetic sequence of the two samples that indicated the recent case had been descended from the other, suggesting that there has been community spread throughout the region, the outlet reported.
“I believe we’re facing an already substantial outbreak in Washington State that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to China,” Bedford tweeted.
His findings come after officials confirmed a patient who died at a Seattle-area hospital was the first coronavirus death in the US.
There were also two presumptive cases in the same suburb linked to a longterm care facility, Life Care Center of Kirkland.
“In addition, over 50 individuals associated with Life Care are reportedly ill with respiratory symptoms or hospitalized with pneumonia or other respiratory conditions of unknown cause and are being tested for COVID-19,” Seattle and King County officials said.

“Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!” US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams complained Saturday on Twitter.
“They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”
Adams insisted that “everyday preventive actions” were the “best way to protect yourself,” listing “staying home when you are sick and washing hands with soap and water” and seeking help if you are sick.
“Get your #FluShot- fewer flu patients = more resources for #COVID19,” he said of wanting to be able to prioritize the new virus that experts warn could become a pandemic.
Adams spoke out as the US had its first confirmed death from COVID-19, a man in his 50s who died in a Seattle-area hospital.
“#COVID19 is a serious disease, but for the general public the immediate health risk is considered low,” Adams insisted in a series of tweets Sunday
He also addressed potential hate crimes over the virus, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
“Diseases can make anyone sick regardless of their race or ethnicity. People of Asian descent, including Chinese Americans, are not more likely to get COVID19 than any other American,” he stressed.
Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told CNN that the rush to buy masks is a “psychological thing.”
“The coronavirus is coming, and we feel rather helpless,” he told the network. “By getting masks and wearing them, we move the locus of control somewhat to ourselves.”"

Photos on social media show empty shelves and shoppers with carts piled high with water, canned foods and household needs like toilet paper, along with cleaning products such as Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer.
The panic is most frenzied in the West Coast, especially California and Seattle, both the areas hardest hit by the 71 cases confirmed in the US by Sunday morning, including the first confirmed death.
A Costco in Oregon ran out of toilet paper for the first time in its history, employees told MyNorthwest, saying the last few days had been the busiest they had ever seen, surpassing even prep for the holidays.
“Toilet paper is golden in an apocalypse,” one Costco employee told the site.
It’s not just the US epicenter of COVID-19 that has gone into panic, however, with USA Today reporting wild scenes and long lines at a Costco in Hawaii.
“Local health officials told us not to panic buy and not to freak out … and that was enough to get us to go out and buy everything,” shopper Ryan Ozawa, 45, told the paper."

The 78-year-old man died early Sunday in the intensive care unit at a Perth hospital after he was infected on the ship docked in Yokohama, Japan, officials said.
“Our condolences are with his family and unfortunately he’s the first death we’ve had from coronavirus in Australia,” Andrew Robertson, the chief health officer of Western Australia state, told reporters.
His family was able to speak to him through the isolation window before his death, the Guardian reported.
“This very tragic case is related to the Diamond Princess, so the community shouldn’t be panicking at this stage,” Robertson said.
Australia has 26 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including the man’s 79-year-old wife, who is in stable condition.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Sunday that he was “very saddened” to learn of the man’s death.
“We join his family and friends in mourning his passing,” he tweeted, adding that they “will continue to do all we can to protect Australians from coronavirus.”
He was the sixth passenger to die from the virus from the ship, which has seen more than 700 people test positive for the virus, according to the BBC.
Worldwide, there have been more than 87,000 people infected and nearly 3,000 deaths since the virus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December.

Pence told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that “there will be more cases” in the country. “There’s no question.”
And while the “vast majority” will recover, the veep added to CNN’s “State of the Union” that “it is possible” others will die, too.
A man in Washington state died of the virus Saturday — the first fatality from the bug in the country — and the US has 71 confirmed cases, said the federal Centers for Disease Control and Protection.
“People who have other conditions that would militate toward a worse outcome, we could have more sad news,” Pence said.
“But the American people should know the risk for the average American remains low.”
In the NBC interview, host Chuck Todd told Pence it isn’t “reassuring” that one out of 22 people worldwide who have the disease will die.
There are roughly 87,000 coronavirus cases globally.
Pence said health experts told him the country would be in a “different place” if President Trump has not decided to suspend all travel from China into the US and quarantine people returning from China.
Trump in a tweet on Sunday said the administration would expand on the screening measures announced a day before.
“Coronavirus: In addition to screening travelers “prior to boarding” from certain designated high-risk countries, or areas within those countries, they will also be screened when they arrive in America. Thank you!,” he posted.
Pence, at a press conference on Saturday at the White House, said the administration was putting travel restrictions in place on Iran, Italy and South Korea, where mass outbreaks were reported.
The vice president said Trump wants a “whole government” response to the crisis.
“We’re going to bring the best scientific minds, experts together, and we’re going to, we’re going to work every day to, to contain this disease, to treat those that are contracted,” Pence said on NBC. ” And I’m very confident we’re ready, and I know, and I know that we’ll get through this.”"

The 83-year-old pontiff paused twice to cough while addressing thousands for his weekly blessing from St. Peter’s Square, where he announced that he won’t be attending the Lenten spiritual retreat in the Roman countryside.
He asked for prayers for the spiritual retreat, adding that “unfortunately a cold prevents me from participating this year. I will be following the meditation from here.”
His Sunday appearance marked the first time he had been seen in public since Ash Wednesday in Rome, where he was spotted battling a cold.
The Vatican had not previously specified what was ailing Francis comes as the coronavirus sweeps Italy.
“There is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition,” spokesman Matteo Bruni said on Friday.
Italy has reported more than 1,100 confirmed coronavirus cases, mostly in northern regions, and at least 29 people have died.

The Department of Health said the case, a person in their 40s, is presumed positive and will have to be confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, news station WCAU reported.
The patient, whose identity wasn’t released, traveled in mid-February to Italy, where there’s been a recent outbreak of the virus, which is known as COVID-19.
“We fully anticipated having a first case of COVID-19,” said Director of Health Nicole Alexander-Scott, the outlet reported.
Health officials have begun reaching out to those who have been in contact with the patient, urging them to self-quarantine themselves for two weeks with public health supervision.
“We are not seeing widespread community transmission in Rhode Island, and the general level of risk for Rhode Islanders is still low,” said Alexander-Scott. “However, everyone in Rhode Island has a role to play in helping us prevent the spread of viruses, just like the flu. It is very important that people wash their hands regularly, cover their coughs and sneezes, and stay home if they are sick.”
Meanwhile, the first coronavirus death on US soil was reported Saturday in Washington state — as the number of confirmed cases climbed to 71, according to CDC officials.

The Riverside County Public Health Department declared a public health emergency for the desert cities 110 miles east of Los Angeles, including Indian Wells where the ATP and WTA tours were to play the two-week tournament starting Wednesday.
“There is too great a risk, at this time, to the public health of the Riverside County area in holding a large gathering of this size,” Dr. David Agus, professor of medicine and biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California, said Sunday. “It is not in the public interest of fans, players and neighboring areas for this tournament to proceed. We all have to join together to protect the community from the coronavirus outbreak.”
The event typically draws upwards of 450,000 fans. This year’s field included Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff.
Tournament director Tommy Haas said organizers are prepared to play the event on different dates and will explore options. The decision to postpone was based on the guidance of medical professionals, the Centers for Disease Control and state of California officials, tournament officials said.
Refunds for this year’s event or a credit toward next year’s tournament are being offered.
Riverside County health officials said the individual with the first case of locally acquired coronavirus is being treated at Eisenhower Health in nearby Rancho Mirage after testing positive. The person is not being identified because of confidentiality rules. 
Heath officials are following up on people who may have been exposed and an investigation is underway to find out how the person contracted the disease.
It’s the second case recorded in Riverside County. A cruise ship passenger from Riverside County was diagnosed with COVID-19 recently and is recovering at a Northern California medical facility. That person hasn’t returned home since leaving the Diamond Princess ship.
“We have always known this was a possibility,” said Dr. Cameron Kaiser, Riverside County public health officer. “We have been planning for weeks and are prepared to take the necessary steps to protect the health of our local community.”
A charity event featuring Nadal set for Tuesday night at Indian Wells Tennis Garden has been canceled, tournament spokesman Matt Van Tuinen said. 
Nadal was set to be joined by defending BNP Paribas Open champion Dominic Thiem, Daniil Medvedev, Matteo Berrettini, Stan Wawrinka, Milos Raonic and American Taylor Fritz for the Eisenhower Cup, a $150,000 winner-take-all event.
Earlier in the week, officials had announced several measures to protect players, fans and staff at the tennis tournament. 
Ball kids were going to have to wear gloves and not touch the towels of players on the court. Organized player and fan interaction was also going to be limited at the tournament which is informally referred to as the fifth Grand Slam because of its popularity with players and fans, many of whom come from overseas. Besides ball kids, restaurant and food supply workers were going to wear gloves as well as volunteers taking tickets at entrances. Over 250 hand sanitizing stations were set up throughout the venue."

White House coronavirus task force expert Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that early attempts to send out tests were marred by delays, but that the nation’s testing capacity is “accelerating dramatically.”
“Early on, there were some missteps with regard to the test and some technical aspects to it,” Fauci said.
“But right now, I believe, 1.1 million tests have already been sent out. By Monday, there’ll be an additional 400,000. And by the end of next week, probably around 4 million.”
Federal officials are getting “a better sense” of the scope of the outbreak as it progresses, he said.
“Unfortunately that better sense is not encouraging, because we’re seeing community spread,” which is when the virus spreads locally instead of only to people who were exposed abroad.
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned the elderly and those with underlying conditions — who are more vulnerable to the disease — to steer clear of travel and large crowds.
“If you’re a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, you need to think twice about getting on a plane, on a long trip. And not only think twice. Just don’t get on a cruise ship,” he said.

Ted Cruz is quarantining himself after coming into contact 10 days ago with an attendee of the Conservative Political Action Committee conference who was later diagnosed with the coronavirus.
Cruz said in a Sunday statement he learned of the interaction with the since-infected man last night, but emphasized that he’s not experiencing symptoms and feels “fine and healthy.”
The Republican senator said his contact with the CPAC attendee was limited to “brief conversation and a handshake” at the Maryland event last month.
Health officials advised Cruz “that the odds of transmission from the other individual to me were extremely low” and his “brief interaction with the individual does not meet the CDC criteria for self-quarantine.”
Cruz added: “Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, and because of how frequently I interact with my constituents as a part of my job and to give everyone peace of mind, I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, until a full 14 days have passed since the CPAC interaction.”
Republican Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar also said he is self-quarantining after he spent “an extended period of time” and shook hands with the coronavirus patient at CPAC.

33,Coronavirus going to hit its peak and start falling sooner than you think,https://nypost.com/2020/03/08/coronavirus-going-to-hit-its-peak-and-start-falling-sooner-than-you-think/,2020-03-08 00:00:00,"Nations are closing borders, stocks are plummeting and a New York Times headline reads: “The Coronavirus Has Put the World’s Economy in Survival Mode.” Both political parties have realized the crisis could severely impact the November elections — House, Senate, presidency. And sacré bleu, they’ve even shuttered the Louvre!
Some of these reactions are understand­able, much of it pure hysteria. Meanwhile, the spread of the virus continues to slow.
More than 18,000 Americans have died from this season’s generic flu so far, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2018, the CDC estimated, there were 80,000 flu deaths. That’s against 19 coronavirus deaths so far, from about 470 cases.
Worldwide, there have been about 3,400 coronavirus deaths, out of about 100,000 identified cases. Flu, by comparison, grimly reaps about 291,000 to 646,000 annually.
China is the origin of the virus and still accounts for over 80 percent of cases and deaths. But its cases peaked and began ­declining more than a month ago, according to data presented by the Canadian epidemiologist who spearheaded the World Health Organization’s coronavirus mission to China. Fewer than 200 new cases are reported daily, down from a peak of 4,000.
Subsequent countries will follow this same pattern, in what’s called Farr’s Law. First formulated in 1840 and ignored in ­every epidemic hysteria since, the law states that epidemics tend to rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern or bell-shaped curve. AIDS, SARS, Ebola — they all followed that pattern. So does seasonal flu each year.
Clearly, flu is vastly more contagious than the new coronavirus, as the WHO has noted. Consider that the first known coronavirus cases date back to early December, and since then, the virus has ­afflicted fewer people in total than flu does in a few days. Oh, and why are there no flu quarantines? Because it’s so contagious, it would be impossible.
As for death rates, as I first noted in these pages on Jan. 24, you can’t employ simple math — as everyone is doing — and look at deaths versus cases because those are ­reported cases. With both flu and assuredly with coronavirus, the great majority of those infected have symptoms so mild — if any — that they don’t seek medical attention and don’t get counted in the caseload.
Furthermore, those calculating rates ­ignore the importance of good health care. Given that the vast majority of cases have occurred in a country with poor health care, that’s going to dramatically exaggerate the death rate.
The rate also varies tremendously according to age, with a Chinese government analysis showing 0.2 percent deaths below age 40 but 14.8 percent above 80. A study published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association found zero deaths worldwide among children 9 and under. Zero.
Like the flu, the coronavirus is afflicting high-risk groups: the elderly, those with ­underlying health conditions like diabetes or heart disease and those with compromised immune systems. Are there exceptions? Sure. But that’s the case with almost every complex biological phenomenon of the kind.
More good news. This month, the Northern Hemisphere, which includes the countries with the most cases, starts heating up. Almost all respiratory viruses hate warm and moist weather. That’s why flu dies out in America every year by May at the latest and probably why Latin America has reported only 25 coronavirus cases. The Philippines, where I live, has about a third of the US population, but it’s so damned hot and humid here, so far we have had no confirmed cases of internal transmission.
The only questions are what the impact will be in the Southern Hemisphere, where far fewer people live, and whether it will ­return to the north in the fall.
Still, if you want to try to reduce your ­low risk even further, then use what works against flu and colds. Both the surgeon general and head of the CDC have advised we nix the masks; they don’t work. Instead, wash your hands with hot water and soap or an alcohol solution for at least 10 to 20 seconds. That way you won’t spread any germs when you use the TV remote to flip off the latest hysterical news report.

Italy, the country hardest hit by the virus in Europe, essentially locked down much of its wealthy north, including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic attempt to contain an outbreak that saw the number of deaths leap sharply on Sunday.
More than 107,000 people have been infected worldwide and 3,600 have died, according to a Reuters tally. In Italy, the number of cases jumped 25% in a 24-hour period to 7,375, while deaths climbed 57% to 366. It was the largest daily increase for both readings since the contagion came to light on Feb. 21.
Contracts for the S&P 500 emini fell 4.2% to 2839. The decline indicates how much the S&P 500 might fall when trading begins on Monday.

Fear of the economic damage the coronavirus epidemic poses sent stocks lower on Friday, with the benchmark S&P 500 notching its 10th decline in 12 sessions.

The State Department on Sunday warned Americans to stay off cruises amid the coronavirus outbreak — after hundreds of Americans were sickened on at least two recent cruises last month.
“U.S. citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship,” the State Department said in a statement. “CDC notes that older adults and travelers with underlying health issues should avoid situations that put them at increased risk for more severe disease.”
There’s an increased risk of catching the potentially deadly disease on a cruise ship, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
To curb the spread of Covid-19, many countries have denied entry to ships and prevented passengers from disembarking. In some cases, passengers were allowed to get off ships, but were placed under strict quarantine procedures.
The US government last month evacuated about 300 passengers from a quarantined Diamond Princess cruise in Japan, but the State Department said that “repatriation flights should not be relied upon as an option for US citizens under the potential risk of quarantine by local authorities.”
Passengers on another coronavirus-hit Princess Cruises ship that was stuck off California’s northern coast for over a week finally docked in Oakland on Sunday. At least 21 sick passengers will be hospitalized there."

“Masses of people in the late Saturday evening storm the last trains leaving Lombardy after the draft coronavirus decree filtered by the Government,” he tweeted.
Students at the University of Padua who had been out at bars Saturday night were alerted to the news on their phones and rushed back to head to the train stations.
The quarantine even angered inmates at a prison in Modena, where a riot erupted over their loved ones not being able to visit, local outlets reported.
The extraordinary lockdown measures, which will impact cities including Milan and Venice, will last until April 3.
The death toll from the virus in the country had climbed to at least 366 people Sunday, with at least 7,000 cases.

37,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to fund coronavirus home-testing kits in Seattle,https://nypost.com/2020/03/08/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-to-fund-coronavirus-home-testing-kits-in-seattle/,2020-03-08 00:00:00,"Home-testing kits for the coronavirus could soon be offered through a program backed by billionaire Bill Gates, according to a report.
The initiative funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation would allow people in the Seattle area to swab their noses and send back the samples for analysis, the Seattle Times reported.
Four-hundreds tests would initially be conducted at a University of Washington lab on a daily basis, with the results being returned in one or two days, the report said. Eventually, the testing capacity will be ramped up to thousands of tests each day.
It’s unclear when the program will launch. The organization is still working now to update its software to handle being inundated by requests, according to the report.
“Although there’s a lot to be worked out, this has enormous potential to turn the tide of the epidemic,” said Scott Dowell, who is leading coronavirus response at the foundation.
The testing would limit the need for potentially-infected patients to visit medical centers, where they could spread the virus to others, the organization said.
The initiative would also allow people to answer questions on an online form about their movements or contacts, making it easier for officials to track down others who may have been exposed if they test positive, the Seattle Times reported.
“One of the most important things from our perspective, having watched and worked on this in other parts of the world, is the identification of people who are positive for the virus, so they can be safely isolated and cared for, and the identification of their contacts, who can then be quarantined,” Dowell said.
The foundation, which has already committed $5 million to battle the coronavirus in the Seattle area, said that the home-testing kits could eventually be available statewide.
Washington state has grappled with more than 100 cases and 16 deaths, mostly in the Seattle region.
Worldwide, there have been more than 100,000 cases and 3,500 deaths since December’s outbreak in Wuhan, China."
38,Women fight over toilet paper during coronavirus panic buying in Australia,https://nypost.com/2020/03/08/women-fight-over-toilet-paper-during-coronavirus-panic-buying-in-australia/,2020-03-08 00:00:00,"It looked practically apocalyptic Down Under as women tussled over toilet paper.
Viral video shows three women in a wild fight in an Australian store — sparked by a mother and her daughter hoarding toilet paper amid panic over the coronavirus.
“I just want one pack!” demanded one woman as she confronted the pair who had a shopping trolley piled high with bathroom supplies in a Woolworths in western Sydney.
“No — not one pack,” the 60-year-old mother of the pair said sternly in the video viewed more than 200,000 times after being tweeted Saturday by 9News.
The trio had been seen grabbing each other, trading blows, then blaming each other for starting Saturday’s brawl
“Are you joking? Are you f—ing joking?” one woman was heard asking after onlookers helped break apart the fight, with a staff member telling them, “Look what you’re doing. You’re fighting over tissues.”
The video sparked disgust — and much mirth — online. “Imagine what would happen in an actual apocalypse,” Mr. Gaanz asked in reply, while Cleetus Van Damme said, “We’ll discover a cure for coronavirus before a cure for stupid.”
Police later told 9News that the mom and her 23-year-old daughter were both criminally charged. A 49-year-old woman also involved spoke to police but was not charged, the station said, describing her as the victim but saying she was not injured.
She appears to have been in the right, too — with Woolworths saying it had a four-pack limit on toilet paper amid a national shortage sparked by frenzied panic buying over fears of lengthy quarantines to come.
“It’s just bad behavior by people that are panicking, and there’s no need for that panic,” acting Inspector Andrew New told 9News.
“It’s not the Thunderdome. It’s not Mad Max. We don’t need to do that.”
Woolworths told the station it was working with the police. “We will not tolerate violence of any kind from our customers in our stores,” a spokesperson said."
39,WHO offers advice about using cash as coronavirus continues to spread,https://nypost.com/2020/03/08/who-offers-advice-about-using-cash-as-coronavirus-continues-to-spread/,2020-03-08 00:00:00,"The World Health Organization has urged people handling cash to soap up after as the coronavirus continues to spread to tens of thousands of people across the world, according to a report.
There’s a chance that the deadly infection can be transmitted during the transfer of money, the Telegraph reported.
“We know that money changes hands frequently and can pick up all sorts of bacteria and viruses and things like that,” a WHO spokesperson told the Telegraph. “We would advise people to wash their hands after handling banknotes, and avoid touching their face.”
The international health watchdog added that “when possible it’s a good idea to use contactless payments.”
The organization, however, later clarified its recommendations, saying that it was not warning people to cut out cash altogether.
“WHO did NOT say banknotes would transmit COVID-19, nor have we issued any warnings or statements about this,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told MarketWatch. “We were asked if we thought banknotes could transmit COVID-19 and we said you should wash your hands after handling money, especially if handling or eating food.”
Meanwhile, fears about using bills have prompted the famed Louvre museum in Paris to cut out cash entirely during the outbreak.
The art museum will only accept credit card payments as part of an effort to protect staffers from possibly infected visitors.
South Korea’s central bank also announced last week that it will take banknotes out of circulations for two weeks to limit the spread of the virus.
The move follows efforts in China, where the virus emerged, to destroy cash in hard-hit regions to prevent contagion.
People’s Bank of China ordered the return of paper currency in circulation last month at hospitals, animal markets and buses near the country’s hot zones in order to destruct potentially-contaminated bills, the South China Morning Post reported.
The concerns over possible contamination through cash come as the virus has spread to more than 90 countries across the world.
The virus has spread to at least 105,000 people and killed more than 3,500 others since the outbreak in Wuhan, China.

40,Cuomo: ‘No reason’ to shut down mass transit over coronavirus yet,https://nypost.com/2020/03/08/cuomo-no-reason-to-shut-down-mass-transit-over-coronavirus-yet/,2020-03-08 00:00:00,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo isn’t ready to pull the brakes on public transit just yet, he said on Sunday as he urged New Yorkers to remain calm in the face of the mounting coronavirus epidemic.
“Look, what we do here is, we calibrate to the facts as we know them at the time,” Cuomo told Fox News “Sunday Morning Futures” host Maria Bartiromo. “So, as the facts change, you change your strategy. But, at this time, there’s no reason to close down mass transit.”
The assurance came one day after Amtrak announced it was suspending Acela nonstop service between New York and Washington D.C. until May, due to flagging demand amid the viral outbreak.

Cuomo on Saturday declared a state of emergency in the Empire State, where officials said there are now 105 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 82 in Westchester County and 12 in the five boroughs.
“We haven’t had — to the extent we have big numbers in New York, it’s actually in Westchester, which is a suburban community, as you know, where you have a cluster of cases,” Cuomo said.
Cuomo appeared three times on television Sunday and once in person on Long Island as he urged people to “stay calm.”
“If they know the facts, they will be calm,” he said.
The virus originated in China and has spread worldwide with more than 107,000 cases and 3,600 deaths."

Two caterers from Ramapo tested positive for the illness after working a pair of  gatherings in Monsey: one from Feb. 28 into the 29th at 150 Remsen Ave., which houses a synagogue, and the other March 2 at the Atrium Ballroom, a catering hall.
At least one of the caterers had worked a funeral Feb. 22 or a bat mitzvah Feb. 23 at the Temple Young Israel of New Rochelle in Westchester County, where a lawyer who has been linked to the majority of New York’s positive cases is a member.
The workers’ cases are Rockland’s only two positive cases so far.
County Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert cautioned in an e-mail that anyone who went to either event in Monsey “may have been exposed to coronavirus.
“It was previously believed that these infected individuals had not worked as caterers during these events and it was only through the detective work of one of our investigators that this discovery was made,” Ruppert said in a statement.
“Any person who believes they may have been exposed should contact their health care provider by phone right away. I also ask that anyone who becomes ill with this disease be completely forthcoming with our investigators, it is only with your help that we can prevent the spread of this disease.”
Health officials said they are still monitoring 22 quarantined people in the county.
Steve Cohn, the Atrium’s manager, told The Post on Sunday that the two infected people are a waitress and event maitre’d who were hired from an outside catering company in Spring Valley roughly 2 miles away.
Cohn said none of his “silverware and glasses” were used at the Atrium event, as those items were brought in from the contracted business. Starting Monday, the facility will disinfected, he added. Employees told a Post reporter on Sunday they are taking “precautions” and “cleaning the whole place.”
People coming and going at the 150 Remsen address did not want to comment other than to say the event there involved an outside group, so they weren’t concerned.
Gov. Cuomo said at an unrelated press conference on Long Island on Sunday that he is warning New Yorkers to “avoid large gatherings” to prevent the community spread of the virus.
He announced there are now 105 total positive cases in the state, 82 of which are in Westchester Country.
Cuomo declared a state of emergency Saturday to help contain the spread, following a spike in positive cases."
42,Coronavirus in NY: De Blasio urges sick New Yorkers to stay off the subways,https://nypost.com/2020/03/08/coronavirus-in-ny-de-blasio-urges-sick-new-yorkers-to-stay-off-the-subways/,2020-03-08 00:00:00,"The city could have “hundreds of cases” of the coronavirus in coming weeks, Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged Sunday — as he finally urged people who are sick to stay off the subways.
De Blasio said a person from The Bronx tested positive for the virus overnight, edging up the city’s tally to 13 confirmed patients — adding, “At some point, we could easily be hundreds of cases.
“As best practice, if you are sick [in any capacity], stay off public transport,” de Blasio said.
“If you are sick, you shouldn’t be going to a public event. You shouldn’t be going to work. You shouldn’t be going on the subway,” the mayor told reporters at a city emergency-management office in Downtown Brooklyn.
Last week, de Blasio appeared to dismiss concerns about whether an infected Midtown lawyer rode the train, saying, “The subway is not the issue, the train is not the issue. The issue [with the coronavirus] is prolonged, consistent contact.”
The mayor Sunday offered buses as an option for healthy commuters who don’t want to go on the subway.
“Buses can be very crowded, but if the bus is a less-crowded option and you can use that, please do,” de Blasio said.
The mayor said that in addition to taking precautions regarding mass transit, people can reduce their risk of infection by not touching their faces.
He demonstrated how to cough into your elbow to avoid spreading germs — but later wiped his nose with his right hand.
He said there are now 13 confirmed cases of the virus in the Big Apple, including infected lawyer Lawrence Garbuz, who works in Midtown Manhattan but lives in New Rochelle in Westchester County.
He said 19 people are in mandatory isolation — and 2,176 in voluntary isolation, a figure that “has gone down substantially.”
The mayor identified two places where an infected health-care worker in New Jersey traveled recently in the city: A Westin hotel in Midtown, Manhattan, and the King David Center nursing and rehab facility in Gravesend, Brooklyn.
“A 32-year-old New Jersey health-care provider saw 11 patients [at the Brooklyn facility] while symptomatic but wore a mask. All 11 patients are asymptomatic,” de Blasio said.
The worker “also attended small medical conference in Midtown,” the mayor said, adding that it was a Westin. “All attendees are symptomatic and family is asymptomatic.”
The nursing home said in a statement to The Post on Sunday that the infected worker is a physician’s assistant and, “The CDC is satisfied with our protocols and procedures.”
A rep for Westin said it is complying with CDC recommendations.
As for the potential closing of city schools, de Blasio said, “We’re dealing with a disease that is not fully understood. [But] I will say definitively, everything we’ve seen so far, this is a disease that for a healthy child presents minimal risk.
“Parents want to see the schools keep going as long as it’s safe, want to see their kids getting educated, and we do have a tremendous interest in avoiding the disruption of the city unless there’s a very specific reason to act otherwise.”
Asked if a specific number of coronavirus cases would prompt closure, the mayor replied, “Not as simple as that.
“There’s no simple algorithm. When we get to the point where anything needs to be adjusted, we will.”
Still, he said all international trips involving city school kids have been canceled “out of an abundance of caution,”as the virus sweeps the globe.
He added that “nonessential” international travel for workers employed by the city is on hold, too.
The mayor also announced financial help for small local businesses hurt by virus panic.
He said businesses with fewer than 100 workers that can document a 25 percent loss in receipts because of the virus can apply for interest-free loans of up to $75,000.
Affected businesses with fewer than five employees can apply for grants of up to $6,000, the mayor said.

43,Coronavirus in NY: Westchester lawyer’s family breaks silence,https://nypost.com/2020/03/08/coronavirus-in-ny-westchester-lawyers-family-breaks-silence-on-his/,2020-03-08 00:00:00,"The wife of the Westchester lawyer linked to the area’s coronavirus outbreak has broken her silence about the family’s highly publicized health ordeal — saying she anticipated the “pandemonium” and immediately jumped into action to contain the fallout.
Adina Lewis Garbuz opened up on Friday on Facebook to describe the moment she learned that her 50-year-old husband, Lawrence Garbuz, was diagnosed with the contagious infection.
“When I was first informed of the positive result, I and my entire family immediately provided any and all information to several Departments of Health well into the wee hours of the night in hopes of letting this all be contained as quickly as possible for all of us,” she wrote in a Facebook post.
“As for our law firm, Lewis and Garbuz, as soon as I was made aware of the diagnosis, I personally immediately contacted everyone in our firm and all were quarantined. All have been working remotely ever since. No one is commuting into the Manhattan office and no one will be until we have clearance to do so,” she continued.
“When I first heard that Lawrence was positive, I immediately recognized there was going to be pandemonium all around us,” she added. “Other than offering what I could to stop this from spreading further, all I and my family care about is that my husband/ their father get better. We shuttered the windows, turned off the internet and together stayed strong and in good spirits.”
She and two of the couple’s children, a 14-year-old girl and a 20-year-old son, have also tested positive for the virus, though only Lawrence remains in critical condition. She said the family is focused on his health since she and her children have not experienced symptoms more severe than a “slight cough.”
Lawrence is currently in the intensive care unit at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia Medical Center, she said.
“As for my husband, while he still remains critical, I and my family remain very hopeful of his full recovery,” Lewis Garbuz said. “He is a tenacious person in all aspects of his life and I know he will come out of this strong.”
“He is a very caring hardworking person who constantly cares for his clients and those around him over himself,” Lewis Garbuz said. “I think it is from this that he was run down and susceptible to the illness he acquired.”
Lawrence’s case has been linked to a number of other people infected in the New Rochelle community, where their synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, has been temporarily closed as other congregants and the rabbi tested positive.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday announced that there have been more than 80 patients in Westchester County since Garbuz’s case was first identified.
Lewis Garbuz added, “I am incredibly blessed that my children while still relatively young have the wisdom to know to keep their heads clear and focus only on the important, the health of their dad and those around us.”"

The patients who are at risk of dying may see the virus spread to their lungs, which can prevent their other vital organs from getting the oxygen needed to fight the infection, Bloomberg reported.
“When you get a bad, overwhelming infection, everything starts to fall apart in a cascade,” said David Morens with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “You pass the tipping point where everything is going downhill and, at some point, you can’t get it back.”
Bruce Aylard, assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, said the escalation from mild to severe phases of the illness can occur “very, very quickly,” the report said.

The so-called tipping point likely occurs earlier in older patients or those who have underlying health issues — who have been reported to be at higher risk of dying from the illness, the outlet reported.
Experts estimate there’s around 10 to 15% of patients whose cases become severe. Of that group, there’s another 15 to 20% of cases that then progress to critical, Bloomberg reported.
The death rate has been estimated by the WHO to be around 3.4% — though the figure may be high because mild cases are likely underreported.
Across the world, there have been at least 3,500 deaths as the bug spreads to over 105,000 people, CNN reported."

“I don’t want to preview the plan right now,” Carson told George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week.”
When pressed on his answer, Carson claimed the evacuation operation is still being hashed out for the ship set to dock Monday in Oakland.
“I think it needs to all come from a solitary source,” Carson said. “We shouldn’t have 16 people saying what the plan is, particularly when it hasn’t been formally formulated.”
Carson’s comments come as the cruise announced that it will disembark the ship’s sick passengers from Oakland to medical facilities in California.

At least 21 people, including 19 crew members, tested positive for the virus on the cruise after it was linked to an outbreak in Northern California.
The Department of Health and Human Services said Sunday that some 3,500 other guests will be transferred to federal military facilities for a quarantine period.
Nearly 1,000 California residents will remain in state at either Travis Air Force Base and Miramar Naval Air Station, while passengers from other states will head to Joint Base San Antonio Lackland in Texas or Dobbins Air Force Base in Georgia.
“Throughout the quarantine, passengers will be monitored for symptoms of [coronavirus],” the agency said in a statement.
Meanwhile, US officials are working to arrange for travel home for foreign passengers.
“The Department of State is working closely with the home countries of several hundred passengers to arrange for repatriation to their countries,” the statement said.
The evacuation plans come as the bug has infected more than 100,00 people across the world, resulting in at least 3,500 deaths."

“I can verify that he had no contact with either the president or the vice president,” Matt Schlapp said on “Fox and Friends Weekend.”
“And I can tell you, when the president was on site at CPAC, he lives by what he tells us, because I saw him scrub down his hand and clean his hands more than once while he was on the premises.”
But Schlapp said he came into brief “incidental contact” with the infected man at the conference in Maryland.
“I’m taking precautions. I’m talking to my doctor,” Schlapp said. “I talked to my mom last night, who was at the conference who is 80 years old. She feels like a million bucks. I feel healthy as a horse. My kids do as well, so there’s no indications from anybody I’ve talked to that there are any more problems.”
Schlapp said he spoke to the patient on the phone Saturday night and said the man “is on the mend.”
He also said he has reached out to anybody who “might have had contact with the patient, if I can verify it.”
“I think he was there most of the time, and the patient did not, I would say this, he didn’t spend a lot of time going all over the conference,” Schlapp noted.
The American Conservative Union, which hosted CPAC at the end of last month, announced on Saturday that an attendee tested positive for the virus and is being quarantined.

“Initially we had a posture of containment so that we could give people time to prepare for where we are right now,” Adams said on said on CNN’s State of the Union. “Now we’re shifting into a mitigation phase, which means that we’re helping communities understand you’re going to see more cases. Unfortunately, you’re going to see more deaths, but that doesn’t mean that we should panic.”
“It means that we should take the things that we know work for individuals to protect themselves and make sure everyone is doing those things, like washing your hands frequently, like covering your cough, like staying home if you’re sick and not being around people who are sick,” Adams said.
Adams told host Jake Tapper he believes the virus is contained in certain parts of the US, saying “we actually feel pretty good that some parts of the country have contained it just like when you look at the flu.”
But, he said, “communities need to be thinking about things like should we be canceling large gatherings, what are our telework policies, should we be closing schools.”
“And it’s going to be different in Seattle than what it’s going to be in Jackson, Mississippi,” Adams said. “But communities need to have that conversation and prepare for more deaths.”

The Keio Academy of New York, which has ties to a Japanese university, announced that it will close its campus in Purchase to protect its international student body from the virus that has spread to at least 82 people in Westchester, the Rockland/Westchester Journal News reported.
Japan currently has 502 confirmed cases of the virus, and six people there have died from it — putting it in the top 10 countries globally who have been the hardest hit.
“After consideration of all the medical facts and advice, the Board of Trustees has decided that it must act now in the interests of our students’ safety and wellbeing,” Rieko Ivy, director of development at the school, said in a statement.
The private school, which is affiliated with Keio University in Japan, hosts students flung from Asia, Europe and South America.
Only 10 percent of the student body, which numbers around 320, is from the local area, while the rest hail from other parts of the US and various countries.
The school said the decision was a precautionary measure as no cases have been identified there.
“This is our precautious decision before any case should occur,” Ivy said, according to the outlet.
The school did not respond to a request for comment from The Post on Sunday.
The decision comes after three Jewish day schools linked to an outbreak in New Rochelle, also in Westchester County, were forced to at least temporarily close.
They are the Salanter Akiba Riverdale Academy in The Bronx, the Westchester Day School in Mamaroneck and the Westchester Torah Academy in White Plains. The latter two schools are in Westchester County. At least one case, involving a female student, has been confirmed at Salanter.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency Saturday amid the virus. He said Sunday that overnight, the number of cases in New York climbed to 105 from 89 the day before, with at least a dozen New York City patients.

The infected Marine, stationed at Fort Belvoir, tested positive Saturday after returning from overseas on official business, according to the Department of Defense.
The service member is being treated at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital.
“The [health-care] teams are in regular and close communication with federal, state, local, and private sector partners,” the Virginia Department of Health said in a statement.
The White House has been notified about the case, while the secretary of defense has been briefed on the situation, officials said.
Meanwhile, the Army announced Sunday that it will restrict its service members’ travel to and from Italy and South Korea — two countries particularly hard-hit by the deadly bug.
The military branch will also prohibit foreign troops from participating in training exercises with US forces, a rep told Reuters.
In addition to the Marine, there have been two other US service members who have also tested positive for the virus, which has spread to more than 90 countries.

I don’t want to go because of the travel advisory for coronavirus. My boss said that I am overreacting. Can I decline to go without recrimination?
It is irresponsible for an employer to be so cavalier when it is clearly a serious situation. Even if the chances of contracting the virus are remote, given the current travel restrictions and government advisories, you have every right to decline and not suffer any recrimination as a result. There are such things as video conferencing and telephones, so it’s not as if there aren’t ways for you to participate in the meeting if it is a business imperative. I would explain your position on the matter, point to statements made by the government and other employers about how they will conduct business until the virus is under control, and offer an alternative. Any rational employer would understand, and I believe would be held to account legally if they took adverse action against you.
How do you reconcile with a boss with whom you had a falling out when you left for another job? This was several years ago, so will bygones be bygones? I’m looking for work. Should I bother trying to reach out?
I think it is usual to assume that once you’ve had a falling out with a boss, that bridge is burned, and sometimes it is, but carrying around negativity isn’t healthy. So, unless the falling out is over something egregious where you feel you could never work with the person again, be fearless about reaching out to mend fences. It is a very powerful thing to be able to do. The worst that can happen is the other person doesn’t accept the invitation, but if you don’t try, then you’ll never know. I recently connected with a former colleague with whom I didn’t have the best working relationship. Years later, we realized that it was a different place, time and context and wasn’t personal, so there was no need to hold a grudge. Now I think we’d be very happy to work together again.

Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.
“Sixteen overnight,” said the governor, who declared a state of emergency over the deadly virus Saturday. “We did more tests overnight. … The state now has 105 people who tested positive.”
He suggested that local governments and private businesses have their employees work in shifts, to limit potential exposure at various times.
“We want to reduce as much as possible situations creating density,” Cuomo said. “The private sector has a role in trying to contain it.”
The governor said there are now 12 cases in New York City, 82 cases in Westchester County, five in Nassau County, one in Suffolk County, two in Rockland County, two in upstate Saratoga County and one in upstate Ulster County.
The bulk of new cases popped up in Westchester, where there were around 70 cases reported Saturday. New cases also were seen in Nassau, Suffolk and Ulster counties. New York City’s reported tally remained the same overnight.

“Westchester at 82 is a clear issue,” Cuomo said.
“What happened in the Westchester County was, the person who was positive was in a very large gathering. An infected person in a large gathering can infect many people quickly. We want to avoid large gatherings.”
Still, Cuomo said, “I would get nervous if the number didn’t go up. We want to get more positives.
“The more positive people we find, the better. The more tests we run, the better. The better we can do the containment.”
The governor said the state currently has seven labs at work testing for the virus — but urged the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand the number.
“Please, CDC, approve these private labs,” Cuomo said. “You have misinformed the public about your testing capacity.
“We don’t have the testing capacity we need, it’s essential,” Cuomo said.
“The more positives you identify, the more you can isolate people and stop the spread,” the governor told reporters at a press conference on Long Island."
52,Chinese man dies from coronavirus five days after getting all-clear to leave hospital,https://nypost.com/2020/03/08/chinese-man-dies-from-coronavirus-five-days-after-getting-all-clear-to-leave-hospital/,2020-03-08 00:00:00,"A 36-year-old Chinese man has died from coronavirus just five days after being discharged from hospital with the all-clear, according to his widow and reports.
In early February, Li Liang had been admitted to a temporary medical center in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 spreading across the globe, his widow, Wang Mei, told the South China Morning Post.
“He only had a low temperature when he was admitted, only just a bit of coughing,” she said, saying he took traditional Chinese medicine twice a day and soon felt so good he volunteered to help at the hospital.
Li was eventually discharged to a temporary quarantine center at the end of the month after two swab tests came back negative for the coronavirus, his widow said.
After initially feeling sprightly enough to exercise daily, he soon started feeling sick again — and eventually died on March 2 after being rushed to Puai Hospital, Wang said.
Coronavirus was listed as the cause of death, according to a released death certificate, according to the International Business Times.
The case is sparking panic in China over the possibility of so-called cleared patients getting reinfected, according to the reports, with a number of Wuhan’s makeshift hospitals suspending plans to discharge patients, according to the Morning Post.
However, officials at the World Health Organisation believe it is more likely that the initial tests that cleared him were wrong, rather than him getting sick again, the International Business Times said.
“From the evidence we have, those cases were not reinfected,” Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit, said, according to the report.
Wang is now left fighting for answers over the death of her husband, who was the backbone of the family and had always been healthy, she said.
“Our lives have been turned upside down,” Wang told the Morning Post. “No matter what happens, I want an answer.”"

“We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job,” the president posted moments after he arrived at his golf resort in West Palm Beach, Fla. “The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!”
The president visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Friday and encouraged people not to panic as cases around the world continue to climb and the virus’ effects on the economy and travel is roiling global markets.
“It will end. People have to remain calm,” Trump said.
The president traveled to his Mar-a-Lago resort in South Florida after the CDC visit.
Trump’s assurances come after Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Saturday declared a state of emergency as the number of cases in the Empire State hit 89 – including 12 in the Big Apple.
There are at least 242 coronavirus cases in the US and 19 people have died from the virus as the CDC ramps up its efforts to get testing kits dispersed nationally.
More than 107,000 people have been sickened by the virus worldwide, and 3,661 have died.
Italy, where the number of cases surged to 5,883 and the death toll hit 233, instituted severe quarantine measures on Saturday that affects more than 16 million people in the northern regions of the country."

Princess Cruises said the liner, which has been stuck off California’s northern coast, headed Sunday to the Port of Oakland to “begin disembarking guests who require acute medical treatment and hospitalization.”
“These guests will be transported to medical facilities in California,” the cruise said in a statement.
So far, there have been 21 people on the ship, 19 crew members and two passengers, who have been infected with the virus.
The remaining guests of the 3,500 onboard will be screened and sent to government facilities where they’ll be quarantined.
California residents will stay in the Golden State while the others will head to federally-operated facilities in other states.
Crew members will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will arrive Monday at the port.
The ship was sailing around Hawaii last week when its previous voyage was linked to a “cluster” of coronavirus cases, resulting in at least one former passenger’s death in northern California.
Princess Cruises previously made headlines over a quarantined Diamond Princess cruise in Japan that left more than 700 passengers infected with the virus.
The former passenger, a 71-year-old man, was among the 19 people who have died stateside from the virus.
Meanwhile, there have been more than 3,400 deaths across the world since the bug emerged in December in Wuhan, China."

As the confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose above 200 in the UK, the 93-year-old monarch was determined to lead by example and continue her duties — even making trips overseas, sources told the Mail on Sunday.
It includes Monday’s historic Commonwealth Day service in Westminster Abbey, with a congregation of 2,000 expected to attend what is Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s final official engagement before Megxit — and also their first time with the rest of the royals since their leaving announcement.
The Queen — who recently wore gloves to hand out awards — is determined to set an example by “keeping calm and carrying on” until there is “compelling advice to the contrary,” a senior royal source told the paper.
“It is thought that if the Queen or other senior members of the Royal Family were to self-isolate or change their plans it might spark panic in the general population,” the source told the Mail on Sunday.
Another source noted that the Queen has always lived up to the motto that first appeared to prepare Britain for World War II.
“The Queen didn’t change her schedule during the swine flu outbreak and has never changed her schedule after terrorist attacks,” the source told the UK paper.
“It’s business as usual,” the source insisted.
COVID-19 has seen another historic institution break centuries-old traditions, with the Pope on Sunday live-streaming his Sunday blessings to large screens because of the health risks in Italy.
Buckingham Palace told the paper it was “following current Government advice.”
“We would not speculate on what that advice might be in the future,” a spokesperson said."

The 83-year-old pope — who tested negative for COVID-19 after suffering from a cold — appeared for a few seconds at a Vatican palazzo window to wave to the small crowd gathered in Saint Peter’s Square.
But he made no comments from the window, with his traditional Angelus Prayer and blessings for the first time ever being streamed onto large screens in the square, broadcast live from the Vatican’s apostolic library.
Francis said he felt “caged” as he delivered his blessings in a way authorities hoped would keep away large crowds during the outbreak that has seen 233 deaths and 6,000 cases in Italy, Agence France-Presse reported.
“I am close through prayer with the people who suffer from the current coronavirus epidemic,” the pope said in his message, AFP said.
“I join my brother bishops in encouraging the faithful to live this difficult moment with the strength of faith, the certainty of hope and the fervor of charity.”
Italy has borne the brunt in Europe of the COVID-19 disease now sweeping the world.
Authorities on Sunday ordered the complete lockdown of some 16 million people — including the cities of Venice and Milan — in a draconian health measure expected to be approved by legislators later in the day.
The pope’s contact with others has been limited in an effort to keep him from being infected. He has stopped celebrating morning Mass before invited guests at the chapel in the Vatican hotel, where he lives. His age and history of respiratory infection – he had part of one lung removed when he was young – makes him especially vulnerable to the disease.

The centenarian patient, who marked his milestone birthday last month, was discharged Saturday from a hospital in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.
He was admitted to Hubei’s Maternity and Child Health Care hospital on Feb. 24 with the coronavirus infection, the report said.
The man suffered from underlying health issues such as Alzheimer’s disease, hypertension and heart failure, the outlet said.
He was treated using antiviral medication, convalescent plasma therapy and traditional Chinese medicine, according to the report. The elderly man was then cleared along with more than 80 other patients Saturday to leave the hospital.
The contagious bug, which is officially known as COVID-19, can be particularly severe for the elderly population and those with pre-existing health conditions.

Anyone breaking the quarantine will face three months in jail, The Guardian reported.
Cinemas, theaters, dance schools, bingo halls and pubs will also be closed — but restaurants will stay open if they can provide seating that keeps a distance of one meter, or a little over a yard, between customers.
The measure, set to take effect immediately, would paralyze Italy’s industrial north, dealing a great financial blow to Europe’s third-largest economy.
The measure was due for a vote as Italy logged at least 5,883 infected patients and 233 deaths. Only two countries have been hit harder by the coronavirus: Mainland China, which has 80,695 infected and 3,097 deaths, and South Korea, which has 7,134 infected and 50 deaths.

“We definitely will see a baby boom, 100 percent,” the Brooklyn-born FUBU founder told TMZ when asked about the possibility.
“Yeah, we absolutely will. It’s like when the blackout happened in New York and everybody stayed at home. It’s a whole bunch of babies nine months later.”
John, 51, also thinks Americans stuck working from home as they hide from the virus stand to benefit from the time shaved off their commutes.
“What are [Americans] going to do when they stay home? You know, if Twitter’s going to close down and say, ‘Hey, everybody’s gotta work from home,’ and you save three hours every single day,” he said.
“Are you still educating yourself, getting a digital curriculum [to see] how you can better your family, or eat healthier, or things like that?”
John said the spread of the virus could even potentially boost manufacturing and give homebound entrepreneurs time to mull a new business idea.
“The reality is, the problem is here,” he went on. “How are you going to adjust it to yourself to get a solution for yourself?"

The woman, 36, had been treated for mild symptoms at an Omaha hospital until Friday. Then her infection took a turn for the worse, officials told Omaha.com.
She was transported for more specialized treatment to the University of Nebraska Medical Center, also in Omaha — secured inside what’s known as an “isolation pod” and handled only by “moon-suit” medical workers.
The woman is currently being treated for acute respiratory distress syndrome at UNMC’s Biocontainment Unit.
The world-renowned, 10-bed unit is designed to safely treat deadly infectious diseases while protecting its highly trained staff and the public from contamination.
The unit has only one other patient — a coronavirus patient from the Diamond Princess cruise line, officials said.
In 2015, the unit successfully treated an Ebola patient, Rick Sacra, a doctor who was working in a maternity ward in Liberia during the height of that epidemic.
The infected woman admitted this week had traveled with her father to England, where she began experiencing symptoms.
She returned from the nine-day trip on Feb. 27 and went to the emergency room at Omaha’s Methodist Hospital on Thursday.
She was tested for coronavirus on Friday, and moved Friday night, officials said.
Epidemiologists are now scrambling to trace with whom she may have come in contact, including basketball players at an area Special Olympics tourney, patrons at an Omaha VFW, and more than 30 health care workers at her first hospital.
“We have to take it seriously,” Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert told Omaha.com. “But that does not mean the entire city will be shut down. We just have to be smart about it.”"

Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans Sunday to halt all visits to inmates in New York City jails  — just hours after the Department of Corrections reported its first COVID-19 positive staffer.
All in-person visits will be suspended starting Wednesday in an attempt to reduce exposure to the virus inside city jails, the mayor said.
The corrections officers’ union lauded the move from city hall Sunday evening that came as part of a package of unprecedented measures in the city to combat the spread of COVID-19.
“We are obviously pleased that the City has finally heeded our call to temporarily suspend inmate visits at our jail facilities,” said Elias Husamudeen, the president of the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association.
On Sunday afternoon, the DOC confirmed it had one civilian staffer who tested positive for the pandemic virus and another in a 14-day quarantine.
The union called for city hall to stop jails visits on Friday to prevent the spread of the virus in what it described as a vulnerable environment.
“In times of crisis, it’s critical for our elected leaders to listen to the boots on the ground and in this case, New York City Correction Officers are the boots on the ground. We know how to keep our jails safe and secure.”
De Blasio said in a release Sunday evening the city would try to make up for the lack of visits by increasing the availability of phones and stamps for inmates to communicate with their families while in city jails during the pause.
The city is also trying to roll out its new “televisit initiative,” allowing people in jail to video conference with people on the outside.

“Due to concerns regarding the coronavirus/COVID-19, Judge Mark Windham has ordered that the People v. Robert Durst trial stands adjourned until April 6,” reads a Los Angeles Superior Court memo.
Jurors were instructed not to return until then.
The judge initially proposed that jurors and spectators leave an empty seat between them starting Monday but scrapped that plan after the virus continued to rapidly spread over the weekend.
The trial, which started 10 days ago, was expected to last five months before the unexpected hiatus.
California has 374 confirmed cases but the actual number of infected is estimated to be much higher, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Durst, 76, is charged with shooting his best friend, Susan Berman, in the back of the head, in 2000, to prevent her from incriminating him in the disappearance of his first wife, Kathie Durst. Kathie vanished in 1982 and Durst remains the prime suspect in her death.

TAMPA — The Yankees have reported the first known case of coronavirus to hit baseball.
The team announced on Sunday a minor league player tested positive for COVID-19.
And it came on a day when it appeared that many of the Yankees would not be sticking around Tampa to work out, after all.
The unidentified player, according to general manager Brian Cashman, reported symptoms on Friday and did not report to camp. Minor league camp was shut down Friday morning and will be closed until March 25 at the earliest.
The minor league side of the Yankees’ spring training complex is not connected to the major league facility, but both will undergo a “deep cleaning,’’ according to Cashman — and it won’t be the first time for the minor league side.
The organization’s minor league players and some staff will also be self-quarantined until March 25.
The Yankees said the player was not in contact with anyone who would have been at the major league complex or Steinbrenner Field and as of Sunday, no other players or team personnel had been tested for the virus and no tests were scheduled. Cashman noted that could change if the situation warrants.
“Is that likely to stick?” Cashman said. “I would say, no, it’s not likely to stick.”
The team has a scheduled off day Monday and could resume some activity Tuesday, but a source indicated that the number of players who end up staying in Tampa will be limited.
Cashman suspected that more players would leave spring training, especially with a case striking so close to home — and on the heels of guidelines sent by MLB to teams strongly recommending — based on information from infectious disease and public health experts — that teams should avoid all activities in which players congregate in significant numbers or are otherwise unable to adhere to the social distancing protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The GM spoke to the team Sunday following the positive test result, as well as the new MLB guidelines.
 

“I think you just have to give them [an] opportunity to process the information and make the best decisions they feel on an individual basis,’’ Cashman said. “I just suspect it’s gonna change because things have continued to change.”
A conference call between the commissioner’s office and the Players Association is also scheduled for noon on Monday.
The unidentified minor leaguer joins Utah Jazz stars Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell, Christian Wood of the Detroit Pistons, as well as an unnamed XFL player among those to have knowingly tested positive for coronavirus in the U.S. sports world.
Mitchell’s father, Donovan Sr., is the Mets’ director of player relations and community outreach and tested negative on Friday after being in contact with his son.
Cashman noted they were following the direction of the Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County after first being alerted by the player, who was at the minor league complex symptom-free on Thursday and didn’t interact with any other team personnel following his departure. The major league team was on the East Coast of the state at the time.
After reporting symptoms, the player was tested and it came back positive late Saturday night, according to Cashman.
By that time, the GM said, most of the player’s symptoms had subsided, but he remains isolated.
At several points during a Sunday afternoon conference call, Cashman pointed out how much the coronavirus situation had evolved in recent days and that the Yankees’ and MLB’s situation could be impacted quickly.
As of Sunday, though, Steinbrenner Field would reopen as planned on Tuesday with a “rolled-back workforce.”
Players will be permitted to work with major league coaches, trainers and the strength coaches “for now,’’ Cashman said.
Asked if he believed MLB should simply close spring training entirely, Cashman said, “That would be above my pay grade. Clearly, throughout the country, all [kinds of] businesses have been shut down because, obviously, they’re evaluating on a day in, day out, week in, week out, month in, month out basis what needs to be done and what we should be doing as a society.”"

WASHINGTON — It’s the Democratic presidential debate: Coronavirus edition.
Sunday night’s debate is keeping former veep Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders at a safe distance amid the deadly pandemic, with the two men debating each other from lecterns placed six feet away from each other.
In fact the two candidates eschewed the usual handshake when they took the stage in DC, instead exchanging an elbow bump.
Unlike rancorous and crowded debates early in the contest, Sunday’s sparring match — which could very well be the last of the primary contest — is being conducted in a closed CNN set in Washington as officials warn against crowds to stop the spread of COVID-19.
CNN tweeted a photo of the set just before the 8 p.m. kickoff, writing: “The podiums are placed 6 feet apart, in accordance with CDC guidelines.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended no gatherings of more than 50 people for the next 8 weeks."
65,Biden shows once and for all why he deserves the Democratic nomination: Goodwin,https://nypost.com/2020/03/15/biden-shows-once-and-for-all-why-he-deserves-the-democratic-nomination-goodwin/,2020-03-15 00:00:00,"In the run-up to Sunday’s debate, I surely wasn’t alone in wondering why it was being held. The coronavirus pandemic is rattling the world and daily life in America is changing at the blink of an eye.
Does anything else matter? And do we really need to hear what Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have to say about it?
It turns out we didn’t, because neither man said anything significantly new or insightful on the topic. Nonetheless, the debate turned out to be important and anyone who sat through what often seemed like the longest two hours in television was rewarded. The pain was not in vain.
By the end, Biden had proved decisively why he’s more deserving to be the Democratic nominee. It was far and away his best debate yet.
Sanders, meanwhile, proved why he’s got a cult following and will never have anything more. At every opportunity, he saddled up his hobby horse of Medicare for All and rode it into the ground. He’s obsessively single-minded, and that’s not a compliment.
Even worse, he made no attempt to hide his hatred for the nation, despite the fact that we are under siege. At one point, Sanders said the current crisis proved we had to “rethink America” because we are rotten with “greed and corruption.”
He also made the extraordinary charge that there’s a “bunch of crooks running the pharmaceutical industry” and that they are saying, “Oh, what an opportunity to make a fortune.”
It was a despicable attack on the American companies that employ hundreds of thousands of people and are pitching in to help save lives.
Has Sanders ever helped anybody but himself? I find nothing admirable in a man who has spent his entire adult life denying the greatness of America while getting rich in the process. Remember, he’s a socialist with three homes.
For his part, Biden made only a few minor gaffes and there were no obvious brain-freeze or cringe-worthy moments. It had to be reassuring to his supporters and donors that he was focused and consistently made solid, relevant arguments.
Overall, he played it safe while still drawing important contrasts. He repeatedly chided Sanders for bringing up Medicare for All, saying this was an emergency and we needed to do things quickly to help people, not try to fight a “revolution.”
“This is like a war and being attacked from abroad. This is like a war,” Biden said.
Another time, he noted that Italy had a single-payer system of the kind Sanders wants and was suffering one of the worst outbreaks of the deadly scourge.
In an obvious appeal to Sanders’ supporters, Biden said they both wanted the same things, starting with beating President Trump. They only differed, Biden said, in the details, and he cited Sanders’ support for the gazillion-dollar Green New Deal as another example.
No doubt the Trump campaign will make sure voters know that Biden thinks he and Sanders share the same policy objectives, including on fracking and immigration.
The best news of all is that we likely won’t have to endure another Democratic debate. If Biden, as expected, sweeps the table in the four big primary states voting Tuesday, Sanders will have no argument for continuing his campaign. The delegate lead would be insurmountable, and four more defeats would prove that Sanders has not expanded his base.
Yet even as Biden closes in on the nomination, the political atmosphere, like everything else, is turning on its head. For one thing, Trump looked to have a solid advantage with the expanding economy and low unemployment, but now a recession is looking more likely than not.
Thus, the election could turn on an epidemic and an economic stall, two things nobody expected or planned for. That’s what the pros mean when they say that a week is a lifetime in politics."

OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Sunday night that he would order all bars, restaurants, entertainment and recreation facilities to temporarily close to fight the spread of coronavirus in the state with by far the most deaths in the U.S. from the disease.
In a statement Inslee said the ban, to be issued via emergency proclamation Monday, wouldn’t apply to grocery stores and pharmacies and that restaurants statewide could continue take-out and delivery services. King County announced Sunday night it would take these actions immediately.
No time frame was given on how long the restrictions will last. Inslee also revised his ban on events to prohibit gatherings of 50 or more people. Previously the size limit was more than 250.
“These are very difficult decisions, but hours count here and very strong measures are necessary to slow the spread of the disease. I know there will be significant economic impacts to all our communities and we are looking at steps to help address those challenges,” Inslee said.
Public health officials in the Seattle area reported two more COVID-19 deaths, bring the total statewide to at least 42.
Other governors have instituted such measures. California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday called for all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs to close in the nation’s most populous state. The governors of Ohio, Massachusetts and Illinois also ordered bars and restaurants to shutter.
Both additional deaths announced Sunday were residents of the Life Care Center of Kirkland, the suburban nursing home that has been the center of the outbreak in the hard-hit region. They were a woman in her 60s who died Saturday and a woman in her 70s who died Thursday.
That makes 29 coronavirus-related fatalities linked to the nursing home. There are more than 750 confirmed cases statewide.
For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
The vast majority of people recover.
Also, an emergency room doctor at a suburban Seattle hospital that has treated many people with coronavirus has contracted the disease.
EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, Washington, said in a statement Sunday that the doctor was in “critical condition but stable.”
Dr. Liam Yore, the immediate past president of the Washington Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, told The Seattle Times the doctor was in his 40s. Yore told the newspaper the doctor had used personal protective equipment and that it was not known whether the physician contracted COVID-19 in the community or at work."

TAMPA — Masahiro Tanaka threw a bullpen session Sunday — although even he admitted, he has no idea what he’s preparing for.
“Obviously, this is not normal,’’ the right-hander said through an interpreter outside George M. Steinbrenner Field following a brief, informal workout as the Yankees and the rest of the sports world wrestles with how to function during the coronavirus pandemic.
“This is the reality right now,’’ Tanaka said. “As for me, I just keep doing what I need to do. That’s the bottom line.’’
But with spring training games canceled and the start of the regular season delayed at least two weeks — and almost certainly considerably longer than that — no one knows exactly what they are getting ready for.
Asked how he could prepare for an undetermined start date, Tanaka said he was at a loss.
“I don’t know and I don’t think anybody does,’’ Tanaka said. “Obviously, we’re experiencing something like this for the first time.”
Tanaka said he planned on staying sharp, but he wouldn’t build up as he would if the season were going to start in a matter of weeks.
“I’ll just back down a little bit,’’ Tanaka said. “That might change as well.”
 

“Change” is the operative word around the league, as MLB and the Players Association meet to determine the best course of action during the coronavirus crisis, and Sunday released guidelines recommending players not congregate in large numbers.
The situation impacted the Yankees even more on Sunday, when they announced that one of their minor leaguers became the first person affiliated with a major league team to test positive for coronavirus.
General manager Brian Cashman said the Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County was instructing the team on how to handle the situation, adding the player had no contact with any major leaguers.
Tanaka, like much of the rest of the team, said he expected to remain in Tampa to work at the team’s facility until further notice. The Yankees had already planned for Monday to be an off day and they could go back to work at Steinbrenner Field on Tuesday.
Even that wasn’t definite.
“I wouldn’t be able to say 100 percent for sure, just because everything’s so fluid,’’ Tanaka said about how long he planned on remaining in Tampa. “Everything’s changing day by day.’’
And that goes for everything — not just baseball.
Asked if he was concerned a significant portion of the season might be canceled, Tanaka said it was a “possibility,’’ but he also noted that there was not much point in speculating.
“It’s all guessing,’’ Tanaka said. “We don’t know what’s gonna happen. I feel the most important thing right now is to try to strive to see the end of this. I’m not talking about baseball, but the whole thing.’’"

Forced closures of businesses may be necessary to stanch the spread of the coronavirus, some lawmakers said Sunday, as four more New Yorkers died and cases surged to 729 statewide.
With many Big Apple bars and eateries still hopping over the weekend, Mayor Bill de Blasio raised the specter of mandatory closings.
“Right now, this crisis is getting a lot worse very quickly,” he said. “Literally every option is on the table right now.”
De Blasio vowed that the NYPD, FDNY, Department of Buildings and city sheriff’s office would crack down on venues flouting Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s order for those with occupancy limits below 500 people to halve their capacities.
Penalties will include fines beginning at $400 for a first violation and, potentially, arrest, said de Blasio.
Hizzoner’s tough talk came as four new deaths were announced in the Big Apple, bringing the city total to five and the state toll to at least six.
De Blasio said the new fatalities were two men and two women, ranging in age from 53 to 79.
With New York City alone now the site of at least 329 confirmed cases, Comptroller Scott Stringer and Council Speaker Corey Johnson called for shutdowns of all nonessential services across the five boroughs.
“Only essential services should remain open,” tweeted Stringer. “No bars, restaurants, or movie theaters.”
Johnson made a similar call in a statement."

An American Airlines passenger delayed a flight to Nashville for over eight hours by joking about having the coronavirus, according to a report.
The flight was set to depart 6:30 p.m. Saturday from Dallas, but takeoff was hampered by a man, who first refused to lift his tray table, then claimed he had the deadly virus, news station WKRN reported.
“People were freaked out because nobody knew what was going on,” another passenger, Brandon Kenney, told WKRN. “People didn’t know if he was actually sick or if he really didn’t have coronavirus or not.”
The unruly passenger, who was not identified, was ejected from the plane by hazmat crews and police officers, who then explained the situation to freaked-out travelers, according to a report.
“Right after he was escorted off the plane, one of the cops came back and kind of explained the situation to the people that were sitting near him and kind of spelled it out for us and told us not to worry about it and really was just talking about how he was joking about having the coronavirus,” Kenny told the outlet.
But the flight was still delayed by unnerved crew members, who refused to fly after the fiasco, the report said. It was supposed to get to Nashville at 8:40 p.m. Saturday but didn’t get there until 4:40 a.m. Sunday.
American Airlines said the man was arrested for making a false claim, but didn’t provide further comment about the incident, WKRN reported."

Gatherings of 50 or more people should be canceled or postponed for the next eight weeks in order to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, according to new guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The federal agency issued the new recommendation Sunday night, acknowledging that the large gatherings could “contribute to the spread”of the illness.
“This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus,” the agency said.
The CDC gave some examples of events that could be subject to its new guideline. They include: conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies.
The recommendation does not apply to schools, higher education or businesses, the CDC said."

It now looks like the Legislature will pass some state budget this week, then go into recess for a while to see how the coronavirus epidemic plays out. Fair enough — if lawmakers stick to what’s absolutely necessary, and don’t add to the damage.
As E.J. McMahon notes (and warned weeks ago, as the stock market started to dip), this crisis is guaranteed to mean at least a short-term revenue hit for the state and local governments.
Wall Street is way down; much of Main Street is shut down, or will be. Tourism, nightlife and all manner of routine economic activity are on hold — all of them slashing tax payments.
While Gov. Andrew Cuomo has asked state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli to assess the impact, full answers won’t be clear for weeks or months. After all, as the gov notes, “You may be looking at a nine-month economic slowdown across the board.”
Bottom line: What was already a multibillion-dollar budget gap has gotten far worse. That means that all the spending hikes that lawmakers intended have to be off the table. No new programs, no new spending of any kind: The reality is that they’re going to have to slash spending whenever they return to finish the legislative session.
The first instinct of the progressives who run the Legislature — hike taxes in the name of balancing the books — is guaranteed to make the economic picture worse, kicking average New Yorkers when they’re down.
Even more “millionaires taxes” would be self-defeating: As McMahon has noted in these pages, “New York’s tax base is both exceptionally wealthy — and exceptionally fragile.” A full 40 percent of state personal-income-tax revenues are “generated by the highest-earning 1 percent of taxpayers.”
Many of these folks are now telecommuting. Don’t give them fresh reason to move to Florida.
Lawmakers’ duty is first to do no harm: For now, assume that federal aid — more than $7 billion in new Medicaid funds alone, thanks to Sen. Chuck Schumer — will cover the immediate crisis.
Pass a bare-bones budget so state and local governments can continue to function during the crisis. Figure out the rest when everyone is on the other side of the lockdowns."

PORT ST. LUCIE — A chartered bus carrying several of the Mets’ minor league players departed from a back parking lot at the team’s spring training complex Sunday and won’t soon be returning.
In the latest measure to contain the spread of coronavirus, the Mets closed their minor league facility and sent players home. The shutdown came on the same day it was announced a Yankees minor league player had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.
The Mets are expected – per recommendation of MLB – to cease group activities for major league players who had chosen to stay behind for workouts. Several players were at the complex Sunday morning for such a voluntary workout, according to a person on the premises. Other players had already opted to depart for home or New York.
An industry source indicated it’s likely group workouts will cease for at least two weeks. At that time the situation will be reevaluated, but with Opening Day on hold indefinitely there likely won’t be a rush. MLB originally had stated the start of the season would be delayed “at least two weeks.”
Already it appears probable April is lost, with team officials hopeful a May start-up is possible.
Among the myriad decisions MLB will face in implementing a new schedule is whether the Mets and Marlins will still play a three-game series in San Juan, Puerto Rico. That series is scheduled for April 28-30.
 

The Mets’ immediate attention, according to a club spokesman, has been on ensuring the safety of players and staff. To this point the only known member of the organization to be tested for coronavirus is director of player relations and community outreach Donovan Mitchell Sr. That test was negative, according to the team. Mitchell’s son, Utah Jazz star Donovan Mitchell Jr., tested positive for the virus last week. The elder Mitchell had visited with his son in the days prior before returning to camp.
Within a stretch of 72 hours, MLB went from playing spring training games to canceling the remainder of the Grapefruit and Cactus League seasons to clearing spring training facilities.
One Mets player contacted for comment Sunday declined, saying he didn’t have enough information about the situation. Another player indicated all inquiries should be directed toward the team’s public relations staff.
Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen is expected to remain in Florida with members of the baseball operations staff on a short-term basis. Most of the team’s public relations staff will return to New York on Monday."

A New York county leader is catching flak for defiantly dining out in Nyack on Friday instead of staying home — a day after the local medical examiner reported that an area resident had died from the coronavirus and mere minutes after the governor warned against large crowds.
““There is a balance between when you can take reasonable steps to protect your health and still enjoy what this wonderful county has to offer,” Rockland County Executive Ed Day, a third-term Republican, posted to Facebook Friday with the hashtag #GotoHellCOVID19. “An hour after the governor’s edict I was with my lady and joined my new found friends Mike and Ann enjoying dinner at an amazing restaurant – Two Spear Street, New American Restaurant&Bar.”
The post includes a picture of him and pal Donna Pascucci smiling together and holding up drinks at the eatery, as well as pictures with their companions.
“Restaurants and other local restaurants are owned by our neighbors and our support makes our economy hum, bringing in revenue that helps our economy. Bottom line is we don’t run; we don’t hide; and we should use every opportunity to enjoy what life has to offer in Rockland,” he said.
Pascucci posted the same picture of the couple on her Facebook page saying, “Life is short. NOT letting Corona Virus spoil our good time and our support for local businesses that are suffering because of the fear and hysteria and spectacular views,” she said
But other Rockland residents were not amused.
County legislator Michael Grant called Day’s promotion of dining out “irresponsible” and noted that many eateries are offering take-home food as an option
“Everyone should assume they’ve been exposed to the Coronavirus,” Grant said.
“Posting on FB is not a good idea. I don’t think he was acting in the best interests of citizens. The message should be social isolation and stay home.”
But Day doubled down after getting blowback on his Facebook page.
“This restaurant maintained that social distance between tables and did add disinfectant,” Day told one critic.
“They complied with the governor’s guidelines of not overcrowding. We need to understand that his is essentially a super flu that a certain cohort can have significant issues with but 80% plus will get and walk through with many thinking all they had was a cold. Is that worth destroying your local economy and neighborhood business?”
Day added, “We need a logical balance here and what we’re seeing is a gross overreaction.”
But Cuomo tweeted Sunday that New Yorkers should “STAY HOME” — not go to clubs and dine out.
“What we do next will have a massive impact on the trajectory of this virus in New York. We can only maintain public health by STAYING APART. The decision each of makes now will impact us all tomorrow. STAY HOME,” the governor said in his tweet.
During a press conference Sunday, Cuomo also urged bars, restaurants and gyms to “voluntarily close down.”
He said issuing an emergency order closing all bars and restaurants “is something we’re looking at” now after hearing that the businesses and residents are not abiding by social distance requirements. Any eatery or watering hole is supposed to slash their seating in half to keep people apart.
Cuomo last week banned all gatherings of 500 people or more — essentially shutting down Broadway theaters and other cultural and entertainment venues."
74,Coronavirus-immune companies could see stocks impacted soon,https://nypost.com/2020/03/15/coronavirus-immune-companies-could-see-stocks-impacted-soon/,2020-03-15 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Companies whose stocks have remained largely immune to the coronavirus could catch a nasty cold once the panic clears, experts warn.
A handful of companies — from consumer staple companies to teleconferencing firms — have been cushioned from coronavirus-inspired stock blows so epic that the Dow’s longest bull run in history was officially declared dead last week.
Teleconferencing firms, for example, have proven one of the few brights spots in a sea of red as virus worries have led more companies to shift to remote work. Silicon Valley-based Zoom, a former unicorn that provides video-conferencing services, has seen a 5.6 percent rise in its share price from Feb. 21 — before the start of the recent market nosedive — to close at $107.47 on Friday.
Shares of ClearOne — which offers teleconferencing hardware including its “Zoom-certified” cameras — is up 25 percent in that time, to $2.13.
But analysts say investors should be prepared for beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic to also become casualties as the recovery takes hold and demand teeters.
“It’s all tied to the panic. People aren’t buying toilet paper because it’s a brand new product with good growth options,” explained Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.
“If panic dies, they’re gonna pay it back,” he said.
Investors have also flocked to consumer staple companies as people across the country stock up on cleaning products and shelf-stable foods amid fears of government-imposed quarantines, like the ones imposed by Italy.
The hoarding got so bad, some companies — like supermarket chain Kroger — were limiting the amount of sanitizers and cold and flu medicines people could buy. Kroger’s stock is up 1.3 percent to $30.17 over the last three weeks, compared to an 18 percent drop in the S&P 500 during the same time period.
Shares of bleach-maker Clorox, meanwhile, actually hit a 52-week high during last week’s stock pandemonium to $178.88. Its shares are now up 1.9 percent to $167.77 over the last three weeks.
The buying sprees have also helped boost shares of canned-soup giant Campbell’s shares — up 2.7 percent since Feb. 21, compared to the 20 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Kimberly-Clark, the Texas-based paper company behind Scott and Cottonelle brands, is down, but by just 4.3 percent since Feb. 21, compared to a 20 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
“People have stockpiled what they need to stay at home over the last 10 days or so, and I think that should result in a good quarter for a lot of those big-box retailers,” Eric Marshall, director of research at Hodges Capital Management, said in a recent interview.
But those retailers’ fortunes could change as the virus slows the economy and hits consumers’ wallets, according to Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull, a trading platform.
“People who are going there to stock up could not come back for some time,” he said.
Experts pointed to the online sports-betting industry as an example of how quickly the tide can turn in a panic.
Gaming and gambling operators were expected to be lifted if, like in Italy, many more people were forced to isolate themselves for a long period to ward off the disease.
Instead, the sports-betting business has “grinded to a halt” after the outbreak has forced major sports leagues to cancel their seasons, explained Jason Ader, CEO of SpringOwl Asset Management, a buyout firm specializing in the gaming, lodging and leisure industries.
London-listed shares of British bookmaker William Hill, which were already trending down on bad earnings, nose-dived on news of the NBA season suspension on March 11. Its shares are off nearly 54 percent since Feb. 21.
Fears of getting the virus are “taking everybody prisoner,” Ader said. “We don’t see too many businesses that are immune to the fear that’s been created around the coronavirus and all the related travel and leisure implications that it has.”

Vice President Mike Pence announced on Sunday that more than 2,000 labs across the country will begin processing coronavirus tests this week.
Pence revealed the national testing expansion at a Sunday afternoon White House press briefing.
The vice president said the new testing capability came to fruition after President Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency.
Since then, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal public health services have “reached out to all 50 states to create a process that will enable all Americans who need to be tested to go to a community-based testing site outside of usual health facilities,” Pence said.
US Assistant Health Secretary Brett Giroir, who was also present at Sunday’s briefing, said the US will have 1.9 million testing kits available this week under the new plan.
“That is a real game changer for us,” Giroir said of the increased number of testing labs. 
Priority will be given to elderly people over 65 with underlying health conditions, and first responders, officials said Sunday.

The election to fill the vacancy was already underway, with early voting beginning last March 13.
Councilman Donovan Richards, the Queens Democratic Party-backed candidate who is considered the front-runner, had urged the mayor and Gov. Andrew Cuomo to postpone the election because of health concerns over the coronavirus.
Richards immediately praised de Blasio in a tweet moments after the mayor’s called off the race.
“Thank you@NYCMayor for recognizing the importance of protecting poll workers and voters in Queens. We should never put politics ahead of the health and safety of our most vulnerable,” Richards said.
De Blasio called the special election to fill the vacancy created after former Borough President Melinda Katz was elected the county’s district attorney, assuming her new role in January.
Sharon Lee, who was Katz’s deputy, is the acting Queens borough president.
The other candidates in the race include former top Queens prosecutor James Quinn — who is backed by the Republican and Conservative parties — Councilman Costa Constantinides, former Councilwoman Elizabeth Crowley and retired cop Anthony Miranda.
The action raises questions about whether New York will move ahead with the scheduled April 28 presidential primary.

“There’s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies,” Trump said, adding that stores will stay open.

Five New York City residents have now died of the coronavirus, as the number of Big Apple cases blew past 300, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday.
De Blasio announced three new deaths in an afternoon press briefing at City Hall.
The newly deceased were identified as a 78-year-old man, a 56-year-old man and a 53-year-old woman.
That’s in addition to an 82-year-old woman who died late Friday and a 79-year-old woman who succumbed early Sunday.
Each of the five victims had at least one underlying health condition — including diabetes and heart disease — that undermined their health battles.

A total of 329 cases have now been confirmed across the five boroughs, representing nearly half of the 729 cases statewide.
The first known state death came last week when a 65-year-old Rockland County man’s life was claimed by the pandemic.

New York City’s schools will close Monday and remain shut until at least April 20 — and possibly the rest of the school year, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday.
“To say the least, this is a very troubling moment, a moment where I am just distraught at having to take this action,” said de Blasio, who had been facing a coup from parents and teachers over his refusal to close the schools amid the coronavirus.
“But I became convinced over the course of today that there was no other choice,” de Blasio said — adding that New York City now has up to five dead and 329 confirmed cases of the virus.
“We may have to go out” for the rest of the school year, “we may not have the opportunity to reopen them,” he warned.
The mayor said remote learning for students would begin March 23, with teachers undergoing “battlefield training.” The mayor added that over the next five days, schools would be open for “grab-and-go meals” for needy students, but that would only last this next week.
“It is quite clear that this crisis is growing intensely,” de Blasio said.
Of the schools closing, he added, “This is a decision I have taken with no joy.” He said the decision was “something not in a million years I could have imagined” having to do.
“We’ve never been through anything like this.”
Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza spoke after the mayor, calling it “a very sobering day for all of us.
“We’re at the last resort,” he said.
Addressing parents and kids, Carranza said, “We want you to think of tomorrow as a snow day. So everybody stays back.”
He said those qualifying for free breakfast and lunch can go to their school for the next week for “grab and go” meals without entering the premises.
The schools chief said teachers will be asked to come to school Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for training while still  “practicing social distance.”
He said the goal is to make sure every student can continue to get their lessons online.
“Enrichment centers” also will be set up at various sites for the kids of health care and emergency services workers, Carranza said.
In the morning, the mayor had been still stubbornly repeating his opposition to the move, insisting he was “very reticent” to shut down the largest school system in the country because of such things as leaving health care and emergency services workers scrambling for child care.
De Blasio’s about-face came soon after The Post published an online editorial Sunday urging him to “close the schools!” — reflecting increasingly harsh criticism over de Blasio’s failure to do what scores of other districts around the metro area, state and country have done to contain the deadly and particularly contagious coronavirus.
The city teachers union had vowed to file a complaint with the state Department of Labor on Monday arguing that the schools were “unsafe” to be in, while Queens Borough President Sharon Lee urged parents to keep their kids home from school even before de Blasio finally made his announcement.
The move came after Gov. Andrew Cuomo appeared to reverse course on the issue, too.
“Bureaucracies do not adjust quickly, but sometimes they have to, and this is one of those times that they have to, and I want them to sit down, figure it out,” the governor told reporters earlier in the afternoon.
He later added on 1010 WINS radio that “all schools down state” would close. His office soon issued a press release saying city schools were closed.
The city now “must develop a plan within the next 24 hours to ensure children who rely on school breakfast and lunch programs will continue to receive that support, and parents — especially critical health care workers and first responders — will be provided access to child care as needed,” the governor said.
He said schools in Westchester County also would shutter as would those in Nassau and Suffolk counties.
The governor had also said he had concerns about what city health care and emergency responders with school-age kids would do if schools closed, as well as over students who rely on government food programs during the week.
De Blasio acknowledged earlier Sunday that his administration did not have a finalized contingency plan in place for an across-the-board closure, despite weeks of warnings about the contagion.

81,Gov. Cuomo to pols: ‘Do your job’ in Albany despite coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/03/15/gov-cuomo-to-pols-do-your-job-in-albany-despite-coronavirus/,2020-03-15 00:00:00,"“Do your job.”
That was Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s message Sunday to lawmakers hesitant to show up in Albany as a state budget deadline looms and two state lawmakers tested positive for the coronavirus.
“Government is an essential operation to manage the situation. To me, that’s like saying: in a war when people might get killed at war, does it make sense to send soldiers?” the governor said Sunday during a press conference, elevating the importance of politicians’ responsibility.
“Should the Congress not show up? Should the police not show up? You’re asking nurses to show up and do their duty.
“It’s not like they’re working in a hospital or taking blood, they’re working in a state Capitol, reading paper and passing bills,” Cuomo continued.
The governor banned gatherings of 500 or more as part of his “density reduction” plan last week, adding guidelines for venues with capacities under 500 to limit their occupancy levels by 50 percent, but the rule doesn’t apply to government buildings.
The City Council will vacate its offices in Manhattan starting Monday, New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson announced Saturday night, and all hearings and staff meetings are canceled.
“This is why you’re in government, this is why you’re here, if you don’t want to be here, you shouldn’t have run for elected office,” said Cuomo.
“If you didn’t want to do a public service at a time of crisis then you should be here.”
“Do your job,” he added.
“Legislators are people, I’m offering them the same guidelines I’m offering everyone. Social distancing, be smart, you’re elected officials be smart, like a business owner, like my kids, like my neighbors like everyone”
Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie announced on Twitter Saturday night two state lawmakers in their mid-60s tested positive for the virus — Assemblyman Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn) and Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein (D-Brooklyn).
The state Capitol Building is now closed to visitors and underwent a cleaning Sunday.
Lawmakers heading back up to Albany have been told to “pack heavy,” anticipating plans subject to change.
State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart Cousins announced Sunday afternoon she’s closing the chamber’s Manhattan office at 250 Broadway.
She’s also advising all member district offices to close — and asking all district office staff and non-essential central staff to work remotely.
“The Senate will return to the Capitol tomorrow for scheduled Session. Plans are being developed for a future schedule and safety protocols while working towards an expedited State Budget,” Stewart-Cousins said in a statement.
Meanwhile state Assembly Democrats had an afternoon planning call, with Heastie encouraging pols to come to Albany at least Monday to vote on two measures.
The first piece of legislation would expand the state’s paid sick leave policy for both public and private businesses, the second would change when campaign petitions are due.

Officials with the Diocese of Brooklyn — which also covers Queens — said the worshiper at Incarnation Roman Catholic Church in Queens Village confirmed to have the deadly bug attended Mass their last Sunday, prompting “a deep cleaning and sanitization” at the church this weekend.
The diocese announced it was halting services at its 186 parishes as a result.
That decision came a day after the Archdiocese of New York covering Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and some northern counties canceled Sunday Mass — including at the iconic St. Patrick’s Cathedral — over coronavirus concerns.
“Attention visitors to the Cathedral. Until further notice all Masses will be canceled,” a sign posted on the doors of the historic church Sunday read. “We apologize for any inconvenience this causes for our parishioners and guests.”
That was bad news for parishioners, some of whom had made pilgrimages from halfway around the world.
“I came here all the way from Glasgow to see it and it’s shut,” said Scottish tourist Brian McCourt, 39. “I’m totally gutted. I was looking forward to it.”
“For me, this was one of the main attractions of New York,” he said.
Carlos Salano said he banked on a visit to the cathedral while up from Orlando, Florida to visit his son in the Big Apple — only to find it one of several landmarks that are currently off-limits.
“The cathedral is closed, MOMA is closed, the Museum of Natural History,” he said. “It’s sad.”
Irish tourist Allan Dransfield, 38, said he had not missed Mass in his entire life — until Sunday.
“It’s very symbolic of change for me,” Dransfield said. “It’s an antibody for the problems of the world.”
The decision to cancel Mass comes during Lent, one of the most important observances for Catholics.
However, church officials said churches in both dioceses would remain open for private prayer, including for two hours during midday at St. Patrick’s on Sunday.
In a statement Saturday, Timothy Cardinal Dolan urged parishioners to tune in to the Catholic Faith Network or the St. Patrick’s website for live-streamed Masses.
Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio said his parishioners can tune in for services on NET-TV, the diocese’s cable channel, the diocese said in a release Sunday."
83,NYC taxis struggle to make ends meet amid coronavirus scare,https://nypost.com/2020/03/15/nyc-taxis-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-amid-coronavirus-scare/,2020-03-15 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Coronavirus has slammed the brakes on the Big Apple taxi industry.
New York City cabbies are suffering a radical drop in ridership amid concerns over the potentially deadly bug, with some only scraping together a few bucks after long shifts behind the wheel.
“We don’t make money,” said Queens cabbie Jones Donkoi while trying to land fares on the Upper West Side. “I collected $300 in fares but if you take the taxes and surcharges and lease payment, I make about $40 at the end of a 12-hour shift.”
“I support three children,” he said. “I’m going to find another job because I can’t continue like this. I can’t buy anything.”
Driver Mohammad Azad said it’s so bad out there that he had just $10 in his pocket after his first three hours on the road on Sunday.
“Our pockets are empty,” said Azad, who was near Spring Street in SoHo Sunday. “If it continues like this, it will be very hard to survive in New York City. All taxi drivers are miserable. Am I scared? Yes. But we take the risks.”
Another driver said he took home just $50 one day last week, and at one point drove around two hours without a single fare.
“I don’t know what’s going to happen,” said the cabbie, who would only identify himself as Patrick. “I am driving around hoping to get a passenger and there are none. They are too scared.”
One cabbie said his family has had to cut down on food spending and even stopped buying laundry detergent to try to get by.
Taxi garages throughout the city told The Post that business has dropped by 30–50 percent as fewer tourists hit the city and more locals stay indoors to avoid contact with the COVID-19 virus.
And cabbies are feeling the squeeze.
“It’s really dire out there,” said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. “Trips dry up after evening hours and with significant loss of airport trips, only small fares remain.”
A chunk of the fares they collect go toward paying off their pricey taxi medallions or, in some cases, the weekly lease payments to garages that rent them their cabs.
“Tomorrow I will ask if my garage can lower the rate to rent the cabs,” said Brooklyn cabbie Abdallah Abdujabar. “Every week I pay $600 plus gas, EZ Pass. It adds up to $800, $900.”
Then there are fees that come out of the fares, including a $2.50 state congestion surcharge and a 30-cent city surcharge.
According to taxi garage owners and dispatchers, the crunch is having a ripple effect on the industry.
Garages that rent out the cabs rely on the drivers’ lease payments to pay off their medallions, and without that money coming, some owners said they risk defaulting on bank loans they took out to make their medallion payments.
“My drivers work a 12-hour shift and they’re not even making the money to pay the lease on the car,” said Mahbub Hassan, a dispatcher at Yellow Cab Crescent Management in Long Island City. “In four hours, they’re lucky to get three rides.”
“We have 268 cabs in our fleet, and 100 of those cars are just sitting there without drivers,” Hassan said. “We have been giving our drivers $200, $300 discounts on the lease, and drivers are still not making enough to cover the lease payment.”
Added a manager at Midtown Operating Corp: “At the end of the day, we are all in the same boat along with the rest of the city. My pockets are not that deep.”
Meanwhile, drivers said they also have to live with the fear that they’re exposing themselves to the virus while trying to make a living.
“They give me three hand sanitizers per shift,” driver Muhammad Boote, a cabbie for 12 years, said of his bosses at Queens Medallion Leasing in Long Island City. “I’ve almost run out. I need to ask for more.”

84,Box office plunges to lowest level in over two decades amid coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/03/15/box-office-plunges-to-lowest-level-in-over-two-decades-amid-coronavirus/,2020-03-15 00:00:00,"Much of public life in the United States essentially ground to a halt this week. In the entertainment world, theme parks shut down, Broadway went dark, studios pulled major tentpoles from their release calendar, and virtually all Hollywood movies and TV shows halted production as coronavirus continues to rapidly spread across North America.
The exhibition industry, a sector of the film business reliant on the communal experience, has been the one institution reluctant to entirely close its doors amid the ongoing public heath crisis. Prior to Friday, fears of the pandemic didn’t appear to impact moviegoing. But this weekend’s box office results show that significantly fewer people are going to their local multiplexes.
Ticket sales in North America hit the lowest levels in more than two decades, generating roughly $55.3 million between Friday and Sunday. The next worst revenues were for the Sept. 15 to 17 weekend in 2000, when movie theaters brought in $54.5 million from holdovers including Keanu Reeves’ psychological thriller “The Watcher,” “Bait” with Jamie Foxx and cheerleading classic “Bring It On.”
Box office figures dropped 45% from last weekend while only one movie, Disney-Pixar’s “Onward,” made more than $10 million over the three-day stretch. The steep decline pushed the year-to-date box office down almost 9%, according to Comscore.
Domestic receipts were inevitably going to plummet this weekend because AMC and Regal, two of the biggest movie theater chains, and several other circuits like Alamo Drafthouse and Arclight, cut capacity in individual auditoriums by 50% to avoid crowding in wake of the pandemic. Reducing the number of tickets sold per theater helped multiplexes comply with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for “social distancing.” Theaters also kept room between rows and seats to ensure patrons had ample space.
In all, low ticket sales were a combination of audiences staying home and theaters capping seating capacity.
“The impact of this unprecedented situation was apparent across many industries,” said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst with Comscore. “Of course, movie theaters, amidst reduced capacity and an ever-evolving set of circumstances, had a very challenging weekend.”
Last weekend’s champion “Onward” remained the No. 1 movie at the domestic box office, as three new films opened to varying degrees of disappointment. “Onward” pulled in $10.5 million in its second outing, a brutal 73% decline from its inaugural weekend. To compare, “The Good Dinosaur,” one of Pixar’s lowest grossing movies, dropped 60% in its second frame. After two weeks of release, the animated fantasy adventure “Onward” has made $60.8 million in North America and $101 million globally.
Faith-based drama “I Still Believe,” from Lionsgate and Kingdom Story Company, pulled in the biggest haul among newcomers and placed second on box office charts. The film, starring KJ Apa as Christian singer Jeremy Camp, earned $9.5 million from 3,250 theaters, slightly below expectations. “I Still Believe” was directed by brothers Andrew and Jon Erwin, whose last collaboration, 2018’s “I Can Only Imagine,” debuted to $17 million and ended up grossing $86 million. “I Still Believe” has an “A” CinemaScore and is performing strongest in the south and midwest. Among opening weekend audiences, 74% were female and 73% were over the age of 25.
Sony’s superhero thriller “Bloodshot,” starring Vin Diesel, launched at No. 3, bringing in $9.3 million from 2,861 venues. Though only slightly behind the studio’s projections, it’s still a disappointing result for a film that cost $45 million to produce. Overseas, the film brought in an additional $13 million this weekend, boosting its global haul to $24.4 million.
“Bloodshot” — which earned a “B” CinemaScore from audiences — was co-financed by Columbia Pictures, Bona Film Group and Cross Creek Pictures. Diesel has had trouble attracting crowds to non-“Fast and Furious” endeavors, although in this case, the virus certainly didn’t help draw ticket buyers.
“The Hunt,” an R-rated political satire from Universal and Blumhouse, came in fifth place with $5.3 million from 3,028 locations, about half of what was expected heading into the weekend. It carries a $14 million price tag. “The Hunt” had been the subject of controversy since it was initially slated for last September. But Universal ended up canceling its release in wake of three mass shootings, as well as intense media scrutiny after President Donald Trump criticized it on Twitter. The film, meant to poke fun at the divide between red and blue states, follows elites who kidnap and prey on average Americans for sport. In an early trailer, those being hunted were referred to as “deplorables.” Universal then set a new release date and turned the turmoil into a marketing play, calling it the “most talked about movie of the year that nobody has seen… yet.” However, once moviegoers did watch “The Hunt,” they seemed somewhat apathetic. It has a “C+” CinemaScore and a 54% average on Rotten Tomatoes.
“The Hunt” came in behind fellow studio offering, “The Invisible Man,” now in its third frame. The Elisabeth Moss-led sci-fi thriller generated $6 million, enough for the No. 4 spot. So far, “The Invisible Man” has a cumulative tally of $64.4 million in the U.S. and Canada and $122 million worldwide.
Though most theaters in North America remain open to some degree, China, South Korea, Italy and other areas greatly impacted by coronavirus have either completely or partially have shuttered multiplexes for weeks. The mass closures have already resulted in billions of dollars in lost revenues.
In light of concerns over coronavirus, exhibitors in the U.S. that stayed open for business took extra precautions to increase sanitation. That included sterilizing seats, arm rests and cup holders more frequently and disinfecting all hand-contact surfaces during peak times.
Studio executives and media analysts recognize the global box office is in uncharted territory, with crucial developments unfolding at a rapid pace. By last Thursday, most major Hollywood films that were set to hit theaters over the next two months — including Disney’s “Mulan,” Paramount’s “A Quiet Place Part II,” Universal’s “Fast 9” and MGM’s “No Time to Die” — had been removed from release calendars as the virus’s infection rate continues to increase. That means even if theaters do keep the lights on, the volume of content available will have dramatically shrunk.
Even so, many remain optimistic that the movie business will be able to rebound.
“These are unique circumstances,” said Jim Orr, Universal’s president of domestic distribution. “But without a doubt, we will get to the other side. The domestic box office will be back, just nobody has a real answer as to when.”"

Transit officials say the agency cleans trains and buses every 72 hours and commonly touched surfaces at stations daily.
The metal worker’s workplace has been disinfected “multiple times,” Foye said. He said he expects more MTA workers will contract the virus.

As the nation adjusts to life amid the coronavirus pandemic, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders will face off Sunday in the first head-to-head debate of the Democratic presidential primary season.
To punctuate the impact of the crisis on the campaigns, the debate was moved from its initial location in Arizona to Washington, DC, to cut down on travel and will be held without an audience as cities and states have cut down on large gatherings of people to minimize the opportunities for infection.
Sanders telegraphed his debate strategy last week, promising to hound the former vice president on progressive issues that are near to the hearts of Sanders’ supporters – including health care, income inequality, climate change and the escalating costs of college.
“Joe, what are you going to do to end the absurdity of the United States of America being the only major country on earth where healthcare is not a human right?” he told reporters in his hometown of Burlington, Vt., last week. “Are you really going to veto a ‘Medicare for All’ bill if it is passed in Congress?”
But the presidential hopefuls will also try to make the case to the American voters that they are better prepared than President Trump to lead the nation during the global coronavirus outbreak.
The debate is an opportunity for Sanders and Biden to burnish their White House credentials in front of a national audience before the next four primary contests Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.
“People have been anxious to beat Trump, but now with coronavirus they are just anxious,” Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Hillary Clinton, told Reuters. “This will be a chance for both of them to look presidential.”
It will be the first debate since Democratic was winnowed in the past two weeks. Currently Biden is the favorite to win the nomination, and Sanders will need to have a strong performance to change that.
As of Saturday evening, Biden had 854 delegates compared to Sander’s 701, out of the 1,991 needed to win the nomination. Also, Biden is leading in polls of the four states that will hold primaries Tuesday.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer competed in the last debate on Feb. 25.
Since then, they have all dropped out of the race, with all of them except for Warren endorsing Biden."

Workers fired or dislocated by the coronavirus have big questions about everything from health care and unemployment benefits to fears of termination and coronavirus exposure.
Employment attorneys and other experts are being flooded with queries from people lacking immediate answers on their most basic rights in these unprecedented times, with many folks nervous about personal finances.
“Many employers are doing the right thing for employees because it is right and makes it safer for them,” said New York-based attorney Vincent White. “Other employers have demanded employees come into work, threatening to fire them if they don’t. I think everyone is expecting quite a bit of litigation when this is over.”
Here are some of the most pressing questions from workers, according to attorneys and other advisers:
What’s the first step for employees let go or furloughed?
They should look into applying for unemployment benefits, advises White. “Every business is handling this differently,” he added. “But for bars and restaurants, many staff are tipped employees. Even if hospitality businesses continuing paying their employees their base pay, that is a fraction of what they might hope to earn in tips.”
How much information can my employer demand if I call out sick?
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employers not require a note from employees sick with acute respiratory illness to verify their illness. The thinking is that health care providers may be stretched to capacity responding to other health calls, according to Workplace Fairness.
Does the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) allow employers to check employees for a fever?
Right now, the answer is “yes,” according to Courtney Blanchard at Minneapolis law firm Nilan Johnson Lewis.
Do you qualify for sick leave if quarantined or in isolation?
Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law that provides some employees sick leave and job protection if quarantined or in isolation by order of a public health official.
“The new law also expands protections to certain employees under the New York Paid Family Leave and the New York disability benefits law to provide some measure of salary continuation during a quarantine or isolation order period,” according to a Nilan Johnson Lewis memo.
Can employers terminate workers who don’t come to work because they are answering calls as part-time first responders?
No, not if they are engaged in civil preparedness planning or work, White said."

But Dr. Nabil Salib’s small business — which is an essential one — is facing a special set of pandemic woes.
Salib, who owns the myDoc urgent care facility in Forest Hills, is seeing his business increase but feels inadequately supplied to face the onslaught of patients that’s sure to come.
“I consider myself a soldier in this war. I am charging into the battle with my staff,” Salib said. But he is worried about the virus overwhelming his clinic — and the entire system.
“We have been waiting for the regular surgical masks for the last three weeks,” he said. “We are also very short on coronavirus testing kits.”
Salib is particularly worried that, because his is a small business, that he will be last in line to receive the kits.
His facility, which is open 12 hours a day, has seen its number of patients roughly double over the past week.
“I used to consider 30 patients in a day a good day. Now we’re past 50 a day,” he said.
“There’s definitely a lot more respiratory patients,” he added. “People coming in with cold symptoms and cough congestion. There’s a lot of anxiety.”
Salib said he is “Lysoling” his office every hour, including every doorknob, chair or surface, preparing for an attack that could fell his patients and colleagues. Luckily, so far none of Salib’s patients, nor his staff of about a dozen, have tested positive for the coronavirus.
“But it is inevitable; it is only a matter of time that someone will get it,” he says.
Salib, who began his urgent facility some three years ago, is also concerned about how this virus will affect him. “I am thinking of isolating myself; that it might be best for my family if I go to live in a hotel,” he said."

A man was robbed at gunpoint in Greenwich Village early Saturday — just hours after he was released from the notorious jail complex due to coronavirus concerns, according to law enforcement sources.
The hapless victim, 36, was walking on West 4th Street near the intersection of Jones Street at around 2 a.m. when two men wearing face masks and hoodies drew a gun and robbed him of his wallet and cellphone, sources said.
No injuries were reported and the suspects remain at large, police said.
The victim is a defendant awaiting trial for an October assault case and told police he was among the incarcerated who was sprung from Rikers on Friday, sources said.
Corrections officials approved the release of a handful of people incarcerated at Rikers Island while awaiting court dates in an attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus in the facility.
At least four correction officers and one inmate at Rikers have tested positive for the coronavirus, with the head doctor at the complex warning earlier this week that a “storm is coming” in that the coronavirus would inevitably spread through the complex.

The diagnostics company Cepheid has received emergency federal approval for the use of its tests — which can detect the virus causing COVID-19 in just 45 minutes, the US Food and Drug Administration announced Saturday.
The tests can be administered on-site at a hospital or doctor’s office while the worried patient waits, and without needing to be sent to a separate lab.
Currently, coronavirus testing typically takes several days, with samples sent to central labs for analyses.
It is the first so-called “point-of-care” test approved by the FDA, with Cepheid planning to make the tech available starting Monday, March 30.
“We are moving into a new phase of testing, where tests will be much more easily accessible to Americans who need them,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.
Health experts have said faster and expanded testing can help reduce the spread of the virus by ensuring those sickened are informed of their diagnoses and take proper quarantine measures.
The tests do require a specific machine called the GeneXpert, Cepheid told CNBC. There are currently more than 23,000 GeneXpert systems around the world, including almost 5,000 in the U.S., the company said.
“Today marks an important step in expanding the availability of testing and, importantly, rapid results,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a statement to the outlet.
“Point-of-care testing means that results are delivered to patients in the patient care settings, like hospitals, urgent care centers and emergency rooms,” he added, “instead of samples being sent to a laboratory.”"

This coming Thursday was supposed to deliver Gerrit Cole overpowering a dreadful Orioles lineup at Camden Yards on Opening Day in the free-agent prize’s debut for the Yankees.
Gleyber Torres’ first crack at replacing Didi Gregorius as the Yankees’ shortstop in a game that counted was going to be heavily scrutinized after he exhibited shaky defense under Florida’s palm trees.
For one game, what remains a ballpark jewel in Baltimore was going to buzz on a day a lot of folks believe is much more meaningful than New Year’s.
Because the spread of COVID-19 has forced MLB to delay the start of the season, however, Cole won’t dominate, Torres won’t charge a ball and baseball won’t be featured in the Inner Harbor.
This will be the first time since 1995 when the Opening Day won’t be played as originally scheduled. Then, it was because of a work stoppage that began the previous September and canceled the 1994 World Series. That was in front of us with the players and owners at each other’s throats and highlighted by the owners’ asinine creation of replacement players, who masqueraded as big leaguers until the sides settled at the 11th hour.
This time, it is a virus we can’t see or hear coming.
“Everybody felt that at some point we were going to play [in 1995] because it really hit home first when the postseason was canceled the year before,’’ Tim Naehring, a Red Sox third baseman in 1995 and the current Yankees’ VP of baseball operations, said Saturday from his Ohio home. “There are a lot of similarities because at some point we are going to play. When? Nobody knows.’’
Anybody who says they do is simply guessing.
Former Yankees reliever Mike Stanton was a Brave in the spring of 1995 and was excited about playing the first game of the season, even after the original one was canceled.
The 1995 Yankees’ first game was April 26 at Yankee Stadium. They beat the Rangers, 8-6, in front of 50,425. Jimmy Key was the winner, John Wetteland bagged the save and the Yankees started the season by winning seven of their first nine games.

In 2001, Stanton was a Yankee when the World Trade Center towers crumbled on Sept. 11.
“I would equate this more to 9/11,’’ Stanton said Saturday from his Texas home. “The question then was: ‘Should we come back? What is the right time?’ ”
Games resumed seven days after 9/11, when the Yankees beat the White Sox, 11-3, in front of 22,785 subdued customers at Chicago’s Comiskey Park. Alfonso Soriano, Jorge Posada and Shane Spencer homered for the visitors.
With the coronavirus pandemic smothering the world and locking down states, the question of “When will the games begin again?’’ is fading.
“I haven’t heard that question in a week,’’ said Stanton, who hosts a pregame television show for the Astros and works for MLB Network Radio SiriusXM radio.
The Yankees have kept Steinbrenner Field in Tampa open for players to work out. Saturday and Sunday it was closed, and there is a chance Florida government leaders will shut it down completely on Monday. That means Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge, who are rehabbing injuries, will have to vacate. So, too, will DJ LeMahieu, Clint Frazier and Tyler Wade, who have been working out at the facility.
Unlike the current situation, in which there is nobody to blame, there was plenty of that in 1995.
“It was something we were going through, and the country was pissed,’’ Stanton recalled.
Most of that wrath was directed toward the players, because fans are more familiar with uniforms than suits.
This time, it’s an invisible enemy that has robbed the baseball universe of Opening Day."

New York City was hit by the nation’s largest coronavirus jail outbreak to date this week, with at least 38 people testing positive at the notorious Rikers Island complex and nearby facilities — more than half of them incarcerated men, the board that oversees the city’s jail system said Saturday.
Another inmate, meanwhile, became the first in the country to test positive in a federal jail.
In a letter to New York’s criminal justice leaders, Board of Correction interim chairwoman Jacqueline Sherman described a jail system in crisis.
She said in the last week, board members learned that 12 Department of Correction employees, five Correctional Health Services employees, and 21 people in custody at Rikers and city jails had tested positive for the coronavirus.
And at least another 58 were being monitored in the prison’s contagious disease and quarantine units, she said.
“It is likely these people have been in hundreds of housing areas and common areas over recent weeks and have been in close contact with many other people in custody and staff,” said Sherman, warning that cases could skyrocket. “The best path forward to protecting the community of people housed and working in the jails is to rapidly decrease the number of people housed and working in them.”
New York officials have consistently downplayed the number of infections in its prisons and jails, The Associated Press has found in conversations with current and former inmates.
The city’s jail agency and its city-run healthcare provider did not respond to messages seeking comment on the letter. On Friday, the city’s Department of Corrections said just one inmate had been diagnosed with coronavirus, along with seven jail staff members. Late Saturday, the department acknowledged 19 inmates had tested positive — two fewer than in the board’s letter — and 12 staff members.
Earlier this week, Juan Giron was transferred to Rikers Island from an upstate facility after his sentence was vacated because the judge had failed to consider him for youthful offender treatment. After going through intake, where he underwent health screening, he was taken to a dormitory that housed more than two dozen men, their beds lined up next to one another, spaced a few feet apart.
“This is like a shelter. So everybody is out and about. You’re talking to people, mingling” Giron said. “Last night, a guy is brought in at around 6 p.m., and a few hours later, two police officers come in with masks and gloves on and try to give the guy a mask. They looked scared, didn’t even want to touch him. They told him to pack up, so he packed up and they took him out. It was crazy.”
“We asked one of the officers and they said, ‘That’s the process we are doing now for guys who have the virus,’” Giron said, adding that others who had had contact with the man have not been questioned or notified about his status.
More than 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the United States — more than anywhere in the world — and there are growing fears that an outbreak could spread rapidly through a vast network of federal and state prisons, county jails and detention centers.
It’s a tightly packed, fluid population that is already grappling with high rates of health problems and, when it comes to the elderly and the intern, elevated risks of serious complications. With limited capacity nationally to test for COVID-19, men and women inside worry that they are last in line when showing flu-like symptoms, meaning that some may be infected without knowing it.
The first positive tests from inside prisons and jails started trickling out just over a week ago, with less than two dozen officers and staff infected in other facilities from California and Michigan to Pennsylvania.
Sherman wrote to Commissioner of New York City’s Department of Correction, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, New York’s Acting Commissioner, and district attorney asserting that those who are at higher risk from infection, including people over 50 or with underlying health conditions, should be considered for early release. So should people detained for administrative reasons, like parole violations, she wrote.
Mayor Bill de Blasio earlier this week said prosecutors were working to identify candidates and by Friday night, prosecutors in New York City agreed to release 56 Rikers inmates on their own recognizance.
Bianca Tylek, executive director of the national criminal justice advocacy organization of Worth Rises, said that wouldn’t cut it.
“There are nearly 1,500 people incarcerated on Rikers Island for low level offenses or technical parole violations who can be released immediately,” she said. “Releasing them would reduce their risk of infection, reduce the risk for all those who remain incarcerated, and reduce the spread of the virus into the public.”
A man incarcerated in New York City, meanwhile, became the first confirmed case in the federal prison system.
The man, who is housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, complained of chest pains on Thursday, a few days after he arrived at the facility, the federal Bureau of Prisons told the AP. He was taken to a local hospital and was tested for COVID-19, officials said.
He was discharged from the hospital on Friday and returned to the jail, where he was immediately placed in isolation, the agency said, adding medical and psychiatric staff were visiting him routinely.
Others housed with the man are also being quarantined, along with staff members who may have had contact with him.
There have been two positive cases among BOP staff members: an employee who works at an administrative office in Grand Prairie, Texas, and another employee who works in Leavenworth, Kansas, but who officials said did not have contact with inmates since becoming symptomatic.
The Bureau of Prisons has temporarily halted visitation at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the U.S., including both social and legal visitation, though officials have said some exceptions could be made for legal visits.
For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and even death.
The vast majority of people recover from the virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover."

An inmate jailed in New York City’s Metropolitan Detention Center has tested positive for the pandemic COVID-19 — marking the first coronavirus case of a detainee in the federal prison system.
The inmate remains in isolation at the federal jail in Brooklyn following the confirmed case, said a spokesperson for the US Bureau of Prisons. 
The inmate was hospitalized for chest pains on Thursday when health officials tested for the bug, according to the BOP
Prison officials “immediately placed [the prisoner] in isolation” once they were released from the local hospital Friday, the spokesperson said. 
On Saturday, the test came back positive and all other inmates housed near the infected detainee were quarantined and affected areas were sanitized, according to the BOP. No staffers in the jail have tested positive for the virus,
The Associated Press first reported the case.
Over the last week, the federal prison system has tried to prevent the spread of the virus in its 122 facilities by suspending inmate visits and limiting prisoner transfers.
Two federal prison staffers — one in Grand Prairie, TX, and another Leavenworth, KS — were confirmed to have contracted the virus on Friday, according to the BOP.
Neither had any contact with inmates, according to the BOP.
The news of the coronavirus case inside the federal prison system comes as civil rights groups warn of the unsafe “breeding ground for infectious disease.”
On Friday, the Legal Aid Society sued the Department of Corrections for the release of more than 100 inmates awaiting state trials.
Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration has said it will release a few dozen inmates who are most vulnerable to the bug from city jails."

Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday warned that Big Apple hospitals are just 10 days away from running out of essential equipment to save lives from the novel coronavirus.
“If we don’t get more ventilators in the next 10 days, people will die who don’t have to die. It’s as simple as that,” de Blasio told Wolf Blitzer on CNN’s “The Situation Room.”
“Bluntly, Wolf, I think we’re about 10 days away now from seeing widespread shortages of really fundamental supplies — ventilators, surgical masks — the things that absolutely are necessary to keep a hospital running,” he said.
“They will not be able to function if they don’t get an infusion of money right away,” he said, saying the city lost “billions of dollars in the past week.”
Despite Hizzoner himself being criticized for failing to put in orders for COVID-19 supplies until March 6, he stuck to his guns in blaming the federal government.
“It sure as hell feels like we’re on our own at the moment. We are not seeing action from the federal government,” he told CNN. “We’re not getting shipments. We’re not getting the stuff we need.”
De Blasio said the crisis — that has seen more than 8,000 cases in New York City with at least 60 deaths — will soon get worse.
“We have only just begun. That is the truth. The worst is yet to come,” he warned. “April is going to be a lot worse than March and I feel May could be worse than April.”
In a separate interview that aired on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday, Hizzoner also President Trump for the city’s supply shortage.
“I can’t be blunt enough: If the president doesn’t act, people will die who could have lived otherwise — senior citizens, folks who are members of families,” the mayor said.
“The president of the United States is from New York City and he will not lift a finger to help his home town. I don’t get it.”
Hizzoner said he has implored the administration to mobilize the military and pleaded with Trump to use the Defense Production Act to use the military to get hospitals and health professionals more medical equipment.
“The military has extraordinary medical capacity of its own that’s been honed in fighting wars,” de Blasio said. “They can handle any situation. All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep like New York. Right now. The military is the best logistical organization in the nation,” he said.
“If there are ventilators being produced anywhere in the country, we need to get them to New York, not weeks from now or months from now, in the next 10 days, and the only force in America who can do that is the military.”"

Dr. Craig Smith, who is the chief of surgery at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, wrote a letter to colleagues Friday predicting that the hospital could be over capacity for coronavirus patients in 22 to 32 days.
“The hard data has become alarming,” Smith wrote in a memo. “I wish I could use a more comforting word.”
Smith said in an update Saturday that the number of undetected patients with coronavirus is likely “much larger than we imagined,” which could put medical professionals at higher risk for the virus.
He said that is has become evident that the virus has already begun to infect colleagues on the frontlines of the health crisis.
“In the past few days it has also become obvious that the virus has breached our Department walls, and we can expect to hear about increasing numbers of infected Department colleagues,” he wrote. “It should be no surprise if these infections appear in clusters associated with the care of infected patients.”
Smith said that “this undermines the importance of deploying providers strategically to minimize the chance of incapacitating all or one specialty because of illness or virus.”
New York confirmed more than 11,600 coronavirus cases on Saturday with at least 4,500 alone in the five boroughs."

New Jersey’s first coronavirus patient says he has been released from the hospital but faces a tough road to recovery since the ordeal has left him on an oxygen machine.
James Cai, a 32-year-old physician assistant, said he was finally discharged Saturday after testing negative twice for the virus that has ravaged his lungs.
“I have my fingers crossed that my lungs will come back,” Cai told The Post on Sunday in a text message, saying he was too weak to talk on the phone.
With no underlying health issues, the Fort Lee dad was in good shape before he was hospitalized March 2 with the virus at Hackensack University Medical Center.
But during his 19-day stint, the dangerous bug ravaged his lungs and he was placed on oxygen.
Cai said was released to his home with a smaller oxygen machine — “like a purse I carry all the time” — and another, larger one for when he sleeps.
“I am only 32 and I cannot rely on oxygen forever,” he said.
Cai said that there’s a chance that lung fibrosis could cause problems for him in the future. His doctors are unable to tell him whether his damaged lungs will ever recover.
“Nobody knows but at least I survived,” he told The Post.
Despite being cleared for the virus, he’s isolating at home while his wife and 20-month-old daughter stay with other relatives for another 14 days as a precaution.
“The longest time for the virus to stay in the body is around 30 days, according to Chinese experts,” he said. “Everybody is safe this way.”
He said that he also cleans all packages with 70% alcohol and then waits 10 minutes to open them.
“My friends and other family members will prepare food and hang them on my doorknob,” he said. “I will wear gloves and mask to get it after nobody is outside.”
Cai was among the 1,327 cases of COVID-19 in the state where the death toll has climbed to 16."

High-profile attorney David Lat is in critical condition at NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan while battling the coronavirus, according to a report.
Lat, 44, founder of the legal blog Above the Law, has been put on a ventilator and is “not doing great,” with doctors “taking it hour by hour, day by day,” his husband, Zachary Baron Shemtob, told the New York Law Journal.
“I just want folks to know that he is so strong. He is hanging in there, and we’re praying he’ll recover,” Shemtob said. “Any thoughts or prayers people have are much appreciated.”
A Yale Law School and Harvard University graduate, Lat is a prominent legal commentator, recruiter and author.
Lat has been outspoken about the COVID-19 bug on his Twitter page and has documented both his illness and his frustration with the health care system since being infected earlier this month.
“Folks, this #CoronavirusOutbreak is no joke,” he wrote Tuesday. “I’ll give you occasional updates, tweeting from ‘Above the Hospital Bed,’ about how serious #COVID19 aka #coronavirus can be.”
Lat tweeted that he had been feeling ill for several days and woke up with fever and chills on March 10.
He said he called his doctor on March 13 and was told his symptoms appeared to indicate he had a flue that turned into bronchitis and was prescribed cough syrup and the antibiotic Z-Pak.
Lat said he went to the emergency room but was sent home — only to return last Monday when he “couldn’t breathe again,” he wrote.
He was finally tested and admitted to the hospital, where his condition has continued to worsen.
“It shouldn’t have taken two separate ER visits, both times with severe respiratory symptoms, to get a #COVID19 test,” he wrote Wednesday. “But that is my experience — and even though the situation is improving, it’s still sadly the case for so many others.”
Shemtob told the Law Journal that Lat’s family has been prohibited from visiting him at the hospital.
“Please be vigilant and careful as possible,” he cautioned."

The Guardian Angels are stepping in to care for the city’s most vulnerable population — the homeless and emotionally disturbed —  who seem to have been forgotten as New York City shutters over coronavirus concerns.
“Nobody is tending to the homeless and emotionally disturbed, a population where it could spread like wildfire,” Guardian Angel founder Curtis Sliwa told The Post Sunday.
The volunteer vigilantes have been out in shifts over the weekend in Penn Station and on the subways — mainly the E train — handing out care packages, stuffed with a sandwich, fruit snacks, hand wipes, water and peanut butter crackers.
But before they got the grub, the homeless had to take steps to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic: wash up.
“What we do is we say look we’ll give you care package… if you wash your hands with our alcohol solution,” Sliwa said.
On Saturday alone, the do-gooders helped more than 400 city vagrants clean up — and gave out 382 care packages. The supplies were donated or purchased by the group.
Sliwa slammed the city for neglecting its displaced or troubled population, fearing without guidance, the virus “could spread dramatically because they are not following advisories.”
“It’s the only way you are going to get them to follow the guidelines and no one is doing it,”  Sliwa said. “The city acts like they don’t exist, the homeless and emotionally disturbed.”
“The city doesn’t do it on a normal day.”
“People are avoiding them. Cops don’t want to deal with them. Absolutely, no Thrive NYC workers out there who should be dealing with this,” Sliwa said of First Lady Chirlane McCray’s embattled signature program.
It was not clear what the city and NYPD were doing amid the outbreak to provide care to the vulnerable population.
“The Mayor’s Office of ThriveNYC is doing everything we can to support the City agencies that implement ThriveNYC programs and provide direct services to the public,” an agency spokesman said.
The NYPD did not immediately respond for comment.
The police department recently hired nurses to help provide care and get homeless people into city services as part of an expansion of the Citywide Mobile Crisis Outreach program."

Mark DeSaulnier is in critical condition with noncoronavirus pneumonia after he fell during a run in the nation’s capital, his chief of staff announced.
DeSaulnier, 67, was hospitalized March 13 with complications from pneumonia after he suffered a rib fracture, according to a statement posted on Twitter Saturday by the Bay Area Democrat’s chief of staff, Betsy Arnold Marr.
It’s unclear exactly when DeSaulnier (right) took the spill.
“Unfortunately, Congressman DeSaulnier’s condition has deteriorated and he is in critical condition,” the statement said. “The doctors are doing everything they can to care for the Congressman.
“Mark’s family and staff appreciate your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.”
When, DeSaulnier was admitted, he was in “serious, but stable condition” and expected to hospitalized for “at least the next several days,” the San Francisco Chronicle reported at the time.
The congressman has also tested negative for the coronavirus.
DeSaulnier’s COVID-19 test was conducted “out of abundance of caution . . . it was purely a box check,” Marr said.
While hospitalized, DeSaulnier on March 14 missed the House’s vote on a coronavirus aid package.
The bipartisan relief package nevertheless easily passed both chambers of Congress and was signed into law by President Trump on Wednesday night.
The relief bill would provide free testing and two weeks’ paid sick leave for full-time workers who fall ill with COVID-19.
The bill also provides $1 billion in food aid to the needy and $1 billion in unemployment funds to states —as the number of US coronavirus cases soared to more than 30,000 on Sunday.
DeSaulnier was elected to congress in 2014 after serving as a state senator and assemblyman in his state, according to his official biography.
The lawmaker serves on numerous committees, including the Education and Workforce Committee and the Committee on Oversight & Government Reform’s subcommittee.

President Trump on Sunday said auto-makers have been given the “go ahead” to begin manufacturing ventilators needed by health-care professionals on the frontlines of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
“Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are?” Trump said in a tweet.
Hospitals and medical facilities have been reporting a shortage of ventilators and other equipment as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to multiply across the country.
The three auto-makers Trump mentioned in his tweet offered last week to use their factories to make ventilators in a massive manufacturing undertaking similar to the efforts during World War II.
The president has invoked the Defense Production Act that allows companies to begin making essential medical equipment.
Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN on Sunday that hospitals in the Big Apple would run out of basic medical supplies — including ventilators — in 10 days.

Some coronavirus patients start feeling like they’re on the mend before becoming severely ill, according to doctors on the frontlines.
Dr. Ken Lyn-Kew, who works at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that patients’ symptoms sometimes appear to subside before their health takes a turn for the worse, NBC News reported.
“That’s what we’re seeing with these patients who get a lot worse,” Lyn-Kew told the outlet. “They’re doing OK, and then all of a sudden they’re really fatigued, a lot more shorter of breath and having chest pains.”
He attributed the dramatic turns to the body trying to determine whether it can take on the bug.
“It seems like there’s a period of time where the body is trying to sort out whether it can beat this or not,” Lyn-Kew said.
Dr. Joshua Denson, who is at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans, said he sees between 10 and 20 patients a day with the virus and has observed a similar pattern.
The COVID-19 cases start off with the patients experiencing mild symptoms — slight cough, headache, fever — before their health begins to deteriorate, he said.
“Patients tend to have symptoms for about a week before either getting better, or getting really sick,” Denson told NBC News.
Across the country, there have been more than 26,000 cases with at least 327 ending in death, according to CNN."

A healthy 39-year-old social worker died days after initially turning down a coronavirus test because she was told she was “low-risk,” her boyfriend said in a heartbreaking Facebook post.
Josh Anderson says he found girlfriend Natasha Ott dead in her apartment in New Orleans on Friday as she still awaited news on whether her sickness and fever were actually COVID-19.
He said Ott — who helped people who are HIV-positive — had first told him on March 10 that she had a “respiratory cold” and “tiny fever.”
“They sent her home, but didn’t test her — she was told she was low-risk,” he wrote, calling his partner “a profoundly kind, passionate, funny and loving 39-year-old woman in good health.”
Her own clinic only had five test kits available, he said, adding she told him, “I declined to take one so someone else could.”
After her condition deteriorated, she finally got tested on March 16 — almost a week after first falling sick — but was told the results would take at least five days, with a further delay meaning they are still not ready, he said.
Anderson detailed Ott’s worsening mood and health, as well as her attempts to reassure him that she would be fine if she just drank whiskey.
He finally “found her dead in her kitchen” at 8 p.m. Friday while checking up because she had failed to respond to texts or calls.
“For those of you not fortunate enough to have known her — know this: it’s an immeasurable loss,” he wrote.
“And seeing a woman I knew to be so full of life lying on the floor lifeless was devastating. I was afraid to touch her. I held her anyway,” he said.
He warned that the “government is ill-prepared for this pandemic in a way that has and will cost lives,” while urging people to “cherish your loved ones like you could lose them.”
“The time for joking about Covid-19 is over,” he wrote.
The Orleans Parish Coroner’s Office has not released a cause of death and state health officials have not confirmed it as a case of coronavirus, the New Orleans Advocate noted."

The loss of taste and smell could be crucial warning signs in “hidden carriers” of the novel coronavirus, experts have revealed.
The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology — which represents ear, nose and throat specialists — says the loss of senses often appears in patients who show none of the earlier known symptoms.
“In young patients, they do not have any significant symptoms such as the cough and fever, but they may have just the loss of sense of smell and taste,” the association’s president, professor Nirmal Kumar, told Sky News.
The association said in a statement that anosmia or hyposmia — the medical terms for the loss of smell — have particularly been noted in COVID-19 hotspots around the globe.
“There have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms,” the statement says. “Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the US, France, and Northern Italy have the same experience.”
In Germany, almost two-thirds of patients have reported losing their sense of smell, while in Korea almost a third have even in “otherwise mild cases.”
“These patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19,” they added.
If wider known, the loss of senses could force carriers into quarantine earlier, slowing the spread, the association hopes."

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday said he’s giving the city 24 hours to find a way to keep defiant city residents from flocking to parks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“It has to be reduced and it has to be reduced fast, and that’s why I’m asking for a plan from them in 24 hours,” Cuomo said during a press briefing, referring to Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson.
“I could make those decisions in NYC,” the governor threatened. “But I think they’re in a better position to do it.”
“They know the problem,” he said. “They see it. I mean, it’s all over the place. It’s not that you need a microscope to find this. It’s all over the city. Now, maybe it was a nice day yesterday, whatever.”
Warmer weather in recent days has prompted many New Yorkers suffering from COVID-19 cabin fever to head outdoors — including the city’s iconic chess players who continue to hit the parks.
The five boroughs are the epicenter for the deadly COVID-19 bug, with 9,654 confirmed cases and 63 deaths as of Sunday morning. City officials said 1,450 people were hospitalized as of Saturday evening, with at least 370 of them in intensive care.
Last week, Cuomo ordered all non-essential businesses closed starting at 8 p.m. Sunday in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus — but was dismayed to see crowds still gathering at the parks on Saturday.
In a tweet Sunday, Johnson said he was on the same page as the governor.
“I support @NYGovCuomo’s call to reduce density in city parks,” the speaker wrote. “We must #StopTheSpread. The @NYCCouncil will do all we can to make this happen.”
“As I said last week, we must get creative, including closing streets to maximize pedestrian space.”
Cuomo, who was in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park over the weekend, suggested city officials close off some streets so stir-crazy New Yorkers could stretch their legs without congregating at the parks."

Toilet paper isn’t the only thing in short supply!
With millions of people cooped up in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic, porn fans are being denied fresh, American smut due to a “mandatory production hold” imposed by the industry’s leading trade association.
The Free Speech Coalition called a halt to the filming of X-rated action over concerns about the testing that some actors recently underwent for sexually transmitted diseases.
The FSC said tests processed by Talent Health Labs of Los Angeles didn’t meet the protocols mandated by the industry group’s “Performer Availability Screening Service.”
“We do not believe there are any active cases of syphilis or HIV in the talent community, but need to clear all talent who recently tested with THL before we can lift the hold,” according to a message for Saturday and Sunday on the FSC website.
The shutdown order, which was announced on March 17, will likely be lifted when re-testing of “all affected talent” is concluded on Tuesday, the FSC said.
But a “voluntary hold” announced March 6 — following “a report from a performer who believes they have a presumptive case of COVID-19” — will remain in effect.
“For our own safety and the safety of the community, no one should be shooting or creating content with others,” the FSC said at the time.
The coronavirus pandemic has led some porn stars to shift to solo performances, with several “cam girls” actually reporting a boom in their business.
Talent Health Labs — founded by porn star Kiki D’Aire, whose credits include “Silicone Sweeties” and “A Knight of Bondage” — said in a prepared statement Monday that its test results “are 100% valid.”
“There was no objection to our testing panel until it was surprisingly rejected last week,” the company said.
“Ours is a 4th generation test based on CDC recommendations and performed at the world’s largest diagnostic testing company, with unsurpassed standards
and resources.”"

“Ten days ago, our D.C. office began operating remotely, hence virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Rand Paul,” he said in another posting."

A small town in Italy appears to have wiped out coronavirus — with zero new cases this week — after an experiment that called for widespread testing, according to a report.
Researchers wrote in an op-ed for the Guardian that the northern town of Vò started testing all 3,000 residents on March 6 after it became home to the country’s first coronavirus death.
University of Padua professor Andrea Crisanti and Antonio Cassone, who is the former director of the department of infectious diseases at the Italian institute of health, said the pilot study involved testing even residents who didn’t show symptoms of the virus.
“We made an interesting finding: at the time the first symptomatic case was diagnosed, a significant proportion of the population, about 3%, had already been infected — yet most of them were completely asymptomatic,” the researchers wrote.
The researchers said the practice “established a valuable principle: testing of all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, provides a way to control this pandemic.”
“This allowed us to quarantine people before they showed signs of infection and stop the further spread of coronavirus,” the researchers wrote.
The result was testing was able to help eradicate the spread of the virus in under 14 days, the report said.
Researchers noted that the study would be “impossible” to replicate throughout the coronavirus-ravaged country due to the number of tests that would need to be performed.
But they said the findings could help inform other policies as the country navigates the pandemic.
“The government could identify and isolate clusters, quarantine everyone affected, trace their recent contacts, and quarantine and isolate them, too — whether they had symptoms or not,” researchers said.
Italy is facing at least 53,578 cases of the virus as the death toll climbs past 4,800, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University."

What was supposed to happen in Vegas isn’t staying in Vegas.
April’s NFL Draft 2020 will be held in a studio instead of in Las Vegas, according to the Los Angeles Times, as the coronavirus crisis continues to force changes across the sports landscape.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced last week that the draft — set for April 23-25 — would go on as planned in Las Vegas but without fans. The league said it was “exploring innovative options” for how to conduct the draft.
But those plans no longer include Las Vegas, the LA Times reported Saturday, citing sources who said the new plans include a studio setting with teams announcing their selections from their own headquarters in cut-ins from the television broadcast.
At a time when the NBA, NHL and MLB have suspended their seasons suspended because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the NFL went ahead with its normal schedule last week for free agency. But the draft — which has become a spectacle in recent years, moving around from Chicago to Philadelphia to Dallas to Nashville — will have to be much different because of the new normal of social distancing across the country.
The draft was originally set to take place in classic Vegas fashion, on a red carpet stage atop the lake at the fountains of the Bellagio. New draft picks and their families were going to be ferried to the stage for interviews.
Now, a studio setting will have to do."

Hospital officials made the “incredibly difficult decision” to ban the partners of expectant moms from labor and delivery rooms, a source said staffers were told during a video briefing on Sunday morning.
“We don’t take this lightly,” Dr. Laura Forese, the hospital system’s executive vice president and COO, said during the briefing.
“This is a significant step. We understand just how difficult this will be.”
Dr. Dena Goffman, chief of obstetrics at NewYork-Presbyterian’s Columbia University Medical Center campus in Upper Manhattan, said officials fear that the coronavirus is so widespread that any visitor could be infected but not yet showing symptoms — and therefore pose a risk to mothers, newborns and medical personnel, according to the source.
Women who are admitted to labor and delivery units will be tested for the disease, regardless of symptoms, and will also have to wear face masks, the source said.
On Wednesday, the state Department of Health advised hospitals to suspend all visitation, effective immediately, “except when medically necessary (i.e. visitor is essential to the care of the patient) or for family members or legal representatives of patients in imminent end-of-life situations.”
NewYork-Presbyterian, NYU Langone Health, Mount Sinai, Northwell Health and city’s Health and Hospitals Corp. all adopted policies with exceptions that allowed visitors for women in labor."

The unions representing cops, firefighters and EMS officers are urging Mayor Bill de Blasio to make them a higher priority for access to coronavirus testing given their front-line duties interacting with the public amid the pandemic.
Ninety-eight NYPD officers and other employees and 17 Fire Department/Emergency Medical Service personnel have tested positive for COVID-19.
The leaders of the unions endorsed a letter sent to City Hall sent by Rep. Max Rose (D-Staten Island-Brooklyn) about the need to expand testing first responders.
The letter was co-signed by James LeMonda, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Officers Association, Gerard Fitzgerald, head of the United Firefighters Association, Paul DiGiacomo of the Detectives Endowment Association, Louis Turco of the Lieutenants Benevolent Association, Edward Mullins of the Sergeants Benevolent Association and Vincent Variale of the Uniformed Emergency Medical Services Officers Union.
In the letter, the congressman and labor leaders for the uninformed officers agree that New Yorkers who are already sick or hospitalized and health care workers who treat them must be the first priority for COVID-19 testing – but add that the uniformed forces should be next in line.
“As we all work to dramatically expand capacity for more and faster testing, we understand that patients whose symptoms are severe enough to require hospitalization and healthcare workers with serious symptoms are being prioritized for testing. We simply ask that first responders be the next group prioritized so that our first responders can continue to do their work and keep our city safe. We appreciate your prompt attention to this critical issue,” they said.
When asked about the call for increased testing, Mayor Bill de Blasio said a press conference Sunday, “The entire testing system is based on the priority of the needs.”
Rose also told The Post: “There are nearly entire firehouses in quarantine right now. We have dozens of cops, firefighters and first responders who have already tested positive for COVID-19. We need to make sure the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe and maintain order during this pandemic are able to quickly get tested when needed. This is a matter of public safety, both for those they serve with and for those in the community.”
The letter to de Blasio also says, “These men and women wake up every morning, put on their uniform and go to work—they do not have the option to work from home. Nor do they have jobs where they can remain secluded away from other people. As they are required to interact with the public and with each other, their health is critical to our city functioning.”
The union leaders and Rose also complained that first responders who have been tested have had to wait several days for the results.
“We hope you agree that this delay is unacceptable and that we must do better,” they said.
But the city Health Department has strict guidelines on testing, in part because of a shortage of protective gear in hospitals and test kits.
Last week, the NYPD did offer testing to cops feeling ill but they ran out of test kits by noon.
“Outpatient testing must not be encouraged, promoted or advertised,” a March 20 memo from Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy health commissioner, to health providers said.
“There is no reason to test asymptomatic persons or mild-to-moderately ill persons who are not hospitalized, including HCW or first responders. Healthcare resources must be saved to treat the sickest patients who require inpatient and critical care,” the memo said.
“There is a national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), collection swabs, and viral transport media supplies and it is critical that laboratory testing be prioritized for hospitalized patients.”
An NYPD spokesman, in a statement, did not directly address the testing issue.
“Obviously, the coronavirus is having a significant impact on all aspects of our lives. The Police Department is no less affected. First and fore-most we are providing for the safety and education of our members. Supplies can be scarce as a crisis unfolds, but we are doing our utmost to ensure personal protective gear is in the hands of the members of our department,” said Detective Denise Moroney.
“We are seeing our sick numbers rise, but not dramatically. And it is certainly nothing we can’t handle. Remember, we have approximately 36,000 uniformed officers and about 19000 civilians. We are seeing a sick rate of around five percent.”"
114,NYC cancels remote coronavirus testing to focus on hospital sites,https://nypost.com/2020/03/22/nyc-cancels-remote-coronavirus-testing-to-focus-on-hospital-sites/,2020-03-22 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The city put the brakes on planned remote coronavirus testing sites Sunday and will instead divert resources to testing facilities at area hospitals.
“We are determining the best way to utilize limited resources while expanding the city’s overall capacity to those most in need under the guidance of state & health officials,” City Hall said in a statement.
“To continue our goal of diverting patients from our emergency departments, the city will redeploy the resources we receive from FEMA to several hospital-adjacent testing locations around the city in the coming days,” the statement said.
The announcement came just hours after a planned by-appointment-only testing site at Pier 88 in Manhattan failed to open to conserve desperately needed masks, gloves and other supplies.
The city said the new approach will allow patients who test positive for the bug to be rushed to the emergency room.
The testing tents were up and running Sunday at 10 city facilities — Bellevue, Elmhurst, Harlem, Metropolitan, Kings County, Lincoln, Woodhull, Queens, Jacobi and Coney Island hospitals, officials said.
Those sites are also by appointment only and are for residents who are suffering from coronavirus symptoms.
The decision to change tactics and shutter the nine planned remote testing sites comes as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the five boroughs spiked to more than 9,600, with 63 deaths, officials said.
For frightened New Yorkers, the delay in available testing has only added to the frustration.
“I have been out of work for two weeks waiting to be tested,” Paula Mata, 24, a healthcare worker who was turned away after showing up at the pier without an appointment. “It’s impossible to get an appointment. I can’t explain my frustration.”
“I called two different hotlines,” she said “I went to many different sites but I couldn’t get an appointment. I heard they were doing testing today and showed up at 7 a.m., the police told us it was canceled.”
The Pier 88 site was slated to be one of several testing sites in the city, including four run by the health department and five scheduled to be run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“I worry for my family,” Melissa Polanco, 25, said outside Pier 88.
She said her symptoms began with a headache followed by a sore throat in recent days.
“I am staying home, but I’m afraid they will get infected as well,” she said. “The people who have symptoms, we want to know where we stand … “"

The pandemic COVID-19 is spreading through New York City jails — as city officials report a total of 46 confirmed cases in the jail system with a dire warning of an exponential increase in the days to come. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Correction said Sunday there were 17 sick staffers and 29 infected inmates.
The news comes a day after the federal prison system reported its first inmate testing positive for coronavirus while being housed in a Brooklyn federal jail.
Nearly another five dozen inmates from Rikers Island and other city jails were being monitored for symptoms.
Board of Correction interim chairwoman Jacqueline Sherman warned Saturday of a harsh reality: the number of cases “is certain to rise exponentially.”
“It is likely these people have been in hundreds of housing areas and common areas over recent weeks and have been in close contact with many other people in custody and staff,” Sherman wrote.
The number of sick staffers and inmates spiked over the last two days — amid grim warnings from the unusual partners of civil rights advocates and corrections officers’ union about the jail’s environment being a powder keg of spread.
The top doctor at Rikers warned a “storm is coming” just days ago.
Sherman wrote in a letter to all state jail officials and the city five district attorneys that their “best efforts will not be enough to prevent viral transmission in the jails.”
The Legal Aid Society has called on the city to cut loose all vulnerable inmates in on non-violent crimes.
“Shared dorms and bathrooms are the opposite of social distancing, and the situation at Rikers Island will only get worse so long as our leaders in government refuse to act,” said Tina Luongo, the attorney-in-charge of the group’s criminal defense practice.
Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration has said it will release a few dozen inmates and review other cases of people who are most vulnerable to the potentially deadly disease.

One of the first congressman infected with the novel coronavirus says it hit him “like a ton of bricks” — with the “tricky bug” constantly returning whenever he thinks he is recovering.
Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, who announced his infection Wednesday along with fellow representative Ben McAdams, said his sickness started with an “absolutely splitting headache” Saturday night.
“Luckily I have not had an issue breathing so I’ve never had a scary moment,” he told his older brother, NBC anchor Jose Diaz-Balart.
“But obviously very very unpleasant with headaches, with coughing and with intense fever all coming at the same time, it seems.”
Although he started Saturday’s interview with his brother saying he was feeling better, he conceded it might not stay that way.
“It’s a tricky bug because just when I thought I was over it — or I was pretty close to getting over it — the fever will come back,” he told NBC.
“But … not as bad as it was originally, and I think hopefully the worst is passed.”

Merkel, 65, was informed about the doctor’s test shortly after holding a news conference Sunday announcing new measures to curb the spread of the virus, her spokesman Steffen Seibert said.
He said that Merkel had received a precautionary vaccine Friday against pneumococcal infection.
For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. About 93,800 people have recovered, mostly in China.
Seibert said in a statement that Merkel would undergo “regular tests” in the coming days and continue with her work from home for the time being.
Merkel had earlier expressed her gratitude to Germans who were following the rules on social distancing, saying it was important to remain at least 1.5 meters (about five feet) apart to reduce the likelihood of infection.
Merkel on Sunday thanked “the overwhelming majority” of Germans who were following rules on social distancing to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
“I know that it means sacrifice,” she said, citing the economic and social costs that the lockdown is having. “I’m moved by the fact that so many are abiding by these rules. This way we show care for older and sick people, because the virus is most dangerous to them. In short: we are saving lives with this.”
Merkel said the lockdown had already affected her profoudly, too.
“My life has also fundamentally changed and now consists largely of phone calls and video conferences,” she said.
The development illustrated how even world leaders aren’t free from the risk of infection.
“With a certain distance the risk of infections is reduced almost to zero,” Merkel told reporters. “Whether you are half a meter apart or 1.5 meters apart makes a huge difference.”
Seconds later, she was informed that her doctor had tested positive for COVID-19."

LAUSANNE, Switzerland — The IOC will look at postponing the Tokyo Olympics during four weeks of talks announced Sunday amid mounting criticism by athletes and sports officials during the coronavirus pandemic.
Consultation with Japanese public authorities, global sports officials, broadcasters and sponsors will deal with “scenario planning” for the July 24-Aug. 9 games, the International Olympic Committee said.
This includes “the scenario of postponement,” the IOC said in a statement, adding “cancellation is not on the agenda.”
“These scenarios relate to modifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on July 24, 2020, and also for changes to the start date of the Games.” the Olympic body said.
The change in strategy followed IOC president Thomas Bach leading a conference call with executive board members.
Bach has consistently said organizers are fully committed to opening the games on July 24 — despite athlete training, qualifying events and games preparations being disrupted more and more by the virus outbreak causing the COVID-19 disease.
Criticism of the stance grew in recent days from Olympic gold medalists and by an IOC member last Tuesday, before Bach finally acknowledged an alternative plan was possible.
“Of course we are considering different scenarios,” Bach told the New York Times in an interview late Thursday.
National Olympic committees in Brazil and Slovenia later called for a postponement to 2021. Norway’s Olympic body said it did not want athletes going to Tokyo until the global health crisis is under control.
The United States governing bodies of swimming and track — two of the three top-tier Summer Games sports — have called on their national Olympic officials to push for a postponement.
“There is a dramatic increase in cases and new outbreaks of COVID-19 in different countries on different continents,” the IOC said. “This led the (board) to the conclusion that the IOC needs to take the next step in its scenario-planning.”
“The (board) emphasized that a cancellation … would not solve any of the problems or help anybody.”
In a separate statement, Bach addressed athletes who wish to compete at the Tokyo Olympics. Of the 11,000 athlete places available in 33 sports, around 4,700 have yet to be allocated.
“Human lives take precedence over everything, including the staging of the games,” Bach wrote. “The IOC wants to be part of the solution.”
Any postponement of the Summer Games would impact the Tokyo Paralympics scheduled for Aug. 25-Sept. 6.
“As you can imagine, potentially changing the dates of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a huge logistical challenge, and the IPC will support the IOC every step of the way,” the International Paralympic Committee said.
“Currently it is vital that everyone, including athletes, stay at home to help prevent the further spread of this horrible disease which is impacting the global community,” the Germany-based IPC said."

Seeking to stem the spread of coronavirus in city jails, officials will release 23 more inmates from Rikers Island and other New York City facilities, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday.
In addition, 200 more people who are vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic will have their case file reviewed to see if they are eligible to be cut free, the mayor said.
“We are looking at each individual case,” de Blasio said during an afternoon press conference.
“We are absolutely going to move very fast now,” the mayor added, saying the process was “complex.”
“Clearly, there are some people we do not feel comfortable releasing.”
This is the second round of inmates released because they had underlying health conditions or minor charges — as well as a low risk of re-offending. The city let 40 inmates out on Friday.
The move comes as the New York City facilities are experiencing the largest outbreak of coronavirus cases in any US jail system — with officials and advocates warning of an exponential increase in infected inmates and employees.
On Sunday, the city Department of Correction said it had 17 sick staffers and 29 inmates confirmed to have COVID-19.
Additionally, 58 inmates were being monitored."

The NYPD now has 98 confirmed cases of coronavirus — and double the average number of cops calling out sick, officials said Sunday.
In one Brooklyn precinct, the entire detective squad called out Sunday, one police source told The Post.
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said 70 uniformed members of the NYPD and 28 civilians employees have tested positive for COVID-19. One person was released from the hospital Sunday while three remained hospitalized, according to Shea.
“The belief is, with very limited information, that it wasn’t contracted at work but from family members,” the commissioner said at a press conference.
NYPD’s confirmed cases nearly doubled from Friday when it reported 52 cases.
Shea said the department had not tracked down members of the public, if any, the cops had contact with while on the job.
“We are in a new reality, that that is not doable,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio.
City health officials backed the mayor and police commissioner, saying the community spread in New York City is so expansive it wouldn’t matter.
Last week, nearly one-fifth of a single precinct called out sick in a matter of days.
In the 71st Precinct — which patrols Crown Heights, Wingate, and Prospect Lefferts Gardens — around a dozen detectives called out Sunday. It was unclear if any of them had tested positive for coronavirus.
Officials have said they expect the numbers of sick first responders to increase due to their continued interaction with the public.
More than 1,000 more officers than normal are out sick during the outbreak — but the commissioner said the department has enough staff and cops won’t be moving to 12-hour tours yet.
“We are still in very good shape in terms of resources,” Shea said."

City schools Chancellor Richard Carranza started working from home Friday — and finally ordered all “non-essential” Department of Education administrators over the weekend to follow suit because of the coronavirus, The Post has learned.
The schools boss issued the edict to staffers at the DOE’s nerve centers — the department’s Tweed Courthouse headquarters in Lower Manhattan and a Downtown Brooklyn building on Court Street — in an e-mail Saturday evening.
The move came less than a week after Carranza canceled classes for the city’s 1.1 million public-school kids amid the deadly pandemic, although teachers were still required to go for in several days to prepare the district’s move to online education for at least the next month.
“It’s about time,” a Tweed staffer said of Carranza’s stay-at-home directive to most staffers. “No one has been happy to come in here.
“People are freaked out, and the general feeling is that this whole timeline should have been moved up a lot quicker.”
Carranza began working away from Tweed last week and will continue to remotely steer the DOE’s rollout of students’ “distance learning” and district “enrichment” childcare centers for the kids of healthcare workers, according to a rep.
Teachers and other DOE staffers have accused both Carranza and Mayor Bill de Blasio of putting them at heightened risk of COVID-19 exposure by failing to shutter schools with existing cases and delaying a systemwide shutdown.
The Court Street facility has had a confirmed case of the coronavirus, which has killed at least 63 people to date in the city.
Carranza’s e-mail said his new directive would help to slow the rampaging contagion among DOE staffers.
“As you know, the single most effective weapon in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing, which is best done by working from home,” Carranza wrote. “DOE has already begun to implement changes in this area, and now we must go farther.”
DOE spokeswoman Miranda Barbot said Sunday that a limited number of DOE staffers will continue to report to the two facilities, as they are considered “essential” to basic operations.
Barbot said Carranza’s weekend order was issued in keeping with Gov. Cuomo’s dictate that all non-essential workers work from home amid the pandemic.
“We have consistently followed the state’s guidance on in-person workforce reduction beginning last week and moving to 100 percent starting tomorrow,” Barbot said.  “We’re so grateful to the workforce who will continue to show up in person and remotely for our students, including teachers who completed essential work in their buildings last week to successfully train for remote learning.”
Remote learning for students is set to begin Monday."

Sarah Hall has heard the stories about her great-grandfather, more and more as the years have gone on. She understands the rising interest in Joe Hall — sometimes dubbed “Bad” Joe Hall for his overwhelming penalty minutes while playing for the Canadiens just after World War I.
Hall was on the team in 1919 when the Stanley Cup final between the Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans was canceled hours before Game 6, when the winner was set to take home the Cup. Too many players were hospitalized with the Spanish Flu, including Hall. Just weeks before his 38th birthday and four days after the game was canceled, Hall died of pneumonia.
Hall became hockey’s face of that pandemic from just over a century ago, one that would kill tens of millions around the world. That year stood as the only time the Stanley Cup was not awarded from its inception in 1892 until the NHL locked out its players and canceled the 2004-05 season. Now with the coronavirus pandemic spreading rapidly, the NHL is in a “pause” phase, facing the grim reality that the season is more likely to be canceled than restarted.
And so Sarah Hall kindly returned a message from a reporter when she had far greater things to think about. She is an anesthesiologist at Nanaimo Regional General Hospital, in beautiful Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Her hospital had not received any patients suffering from COVID-19 as of Saturday afternoon, but she has seen all the graphs and projections and knows that it is coming sooner rather than later.
It felt like the calm before the storm, and Hall was just hoping to prepare herself and her hospital as well as she possibly could.
“Looking at our demographics, they’re projecting that we could need as many as 900 ventilators,” Hall told The Post. “And we currently have — if we include the ones we have in our operating room — 30. So, yeah, it’s pretty dark.”
Hall is not much of a sports fan, which she jokingly said made her “a great disappointment to my family.” That’s obviously not true, as she was about to be on the front lines of a battle that mattered a lot more than anything with a silver chalice as a reward.
“It’s been really, really busy,” Hall said. “As with most hospitals, we’re in the center of preparing airway teams, and trying to cobble together the equipment that we don’t have. Just making a plan.”
In all of the hubbub, she has taken a little bit of time to think about her great-grandfather, whom she didn’t know much about growing up. But it was impossible to avoid the parallels between then and now, even with greater worries swirling in everyone’s mind.
“It certainly has caused me to reflect upon his situation,” Hall said. “But I’m not sure that I can say that it’s more strange. It’s just part of our history.”
 

It is also part of the history of the Stanley Cup — one that a lot of people don’t know about.
That year, the Canadiens were the NHL champions and they were to take on the champion of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), with the winner of the series getting the Cup. The two leagues played by different rules, with seven players per side in the PCHA and six per side in the NHL. All the games were at the Seattle Ice Arena, and the Metropolitans won Games 1 and 3 in blowouts playing by their rules — a combined score of 14-2 — while the Canadiens won Game 2 and 5 playing by their rules.
Game 4 was considered one of the best games in hockey history, with Georges Vezina dazzling in the Canadiens nets to keep it a scoreless match through two overtimes before it was called a draw. It was played under NHL rules, so Game 5 was considered “a replay” and played under the same rules (thereafter it was determined that overtimes would go on until a goal was scored). The Mets were up, 3-0, but then “Frank Foyston got hurt, Jack Walker broke a skate, and Cully Wilson collapsed from exhaustion,” according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. They went on with only four skaters, and the Canadiens tied it before their substitute, Jack McDonald, sprinted onto the ice and won the game in overtime.
Some players had to be carried off the ice, and some went directly to the hospital. Along with Hall, the Canadiens had five players in the hospital or bedridden, along with owner George Kennedy, who would die two years later after being weakened by the flu. (His widow then sold the team for $11,000.) The two clubs decided to call off the series, and in 1948, the league made an inscription on the Cup under the year 1919, saying: “Series not completed.”
“It’s eerily similar,” Sarah Hall said. “There are a lot of parallels, for sure.”
Back then, the world was just coming out of war, and would soon dive into a deep economic depression. Who knows what is going to happen now, with the Stanley Cup or otherwise?

Nigeria on Sunday warned about cases of chloroquine poisoning after the anti-Malaria drug was hailed as a possible cure for coronavirus, according to a report.
Health officials in the West Afrian nation confirmed on Sunday that two people were hospitalized in Lagos for overdoses of the anti-Malaria drug, which President Trump has touted as a potential treatment, Bloomberg reported.
Nigeria’s Center for Disease Control cautioned citizens from self-medicating with the drug, which is still undergoing testing for safety and effectiveness.
“[The World Health Orgniazation] has NOT approved the use of chloroquine for #COVID19 management,” the agency wrote on Twitter. “Scientists are working hard to confirm the safety of several drugs for this disease.”
Oreoluwa Finnih, senior health assistant to the governor of Lagos, also told Nigerians “not to panic” and use the drug.
“Chloroquine is still in a testing phase in combination with other medication and not yet verified as a preventive treatment or curative option,” Finnih told Bloomberg News.
President Trump tweeted on Saturday that:”HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.”
He added that the FDA has “moved mountains” and that hopefully the treatment will be “put in use IMMEDIATELY.”
Nigeria has reported 27 cases of COVID-19 as it spreads to more than 300,000 people across the world, according to figures from John Hopkins University."

2020 watch: Politicizing Pandemic
“A network of Democratic nonprofits and super PACs are funneling millions of dollars toward advertisements” blaming President Trump for the coronavirus crisis, The Federalist’s Madeline Osburn reports. “While the White House is busy trying to secure financial support for Americans and small businesses,” shady Democratic groups are demagoguing the issues in swing states. The left-wing group Pacronym, which plans to spend $5 million on ads in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Arizona, is “the political action committee affiliated with Acronym, the nonprofit that also funded Shadow, Inc., the company responsible for the failed Iowa caucuses-reporting app.” It, in turn, gets cash from a for-profit consultancy, Arabella Advisors, which is “sending funds down through its spider web of nonprofits.” This network is “willing to stop at nothing to attack Trump, even if it means politicizing the growing fears, illnesses and deaths of American citizens.”
Finance desk: Don’t Forget Business Health
“If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two,” warn the editors of The Wall Street Journal, “the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine.” “Even cash-rich businesses operate on a thin margin and can bleed through reserves in a month” — while “millions of small and mid-sized firms” will “lay off employees, and then out of necessity, they will shut down.” Hence the urgent need to figure out a “phase two of the coronavirus pandemic campaign,” one that still protects “our elderly and those with underlying medical problems” while liberating the economy from general restrictions. Bottom line: America can’t “safeguard public health for long at the cost of its overall economic health.”
Conservative: Rethinking a Post-Corona Economy
Yes, “COVID-19 is a serious disease” — but the pandemic, and “the panic it has touched off,” will recede, notes Daniel McCarthy at Spectator USA. And policymakers must focus on the recovery now, even as they combat the outbreak. China, “the source of this global scourge in the first place,” understands this: The Beijing regime has already started “rebuilding its economic base,” even as it “retains a grip on much of the world’s pharmaceutical production capacity.” It goes to show that “real power” still lies in “material production” — something we’re relearning now, after decades of heavy financialization, offshoring and overemphasis on services that left America in such a sorry shape when it came to producing things like masks and pharmaceuticals. Those are painful lessons we’ll need to remember if we want to “weather the next pandemic and economic collapse.”
Trumpian: Biden’s Beijing Kowtow
Team Trump has made a point of referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” partly to remind the world of Beijing’s irresponsible early response and partly to counter the regime’s grotesque falsehoods about America creating the disease. But that response has “apparently bothered” Joe Biden, charges Kayleigh McEnany in The Hill. The ex-veep has “called President Trump’s terminology ‘xenophobic,’  ” while a Biden campaign spokesman recently denounced it as a ­“racial slur.” Earlier, Biden railed against Trump’s preemptive travel ban against China, calling the move “xenophobic” and “fearmongering.” Biden’s rhetoric fit into a broader pattern of offering apologetics for the Communist regime. In October, he ­denied that China poses a threat to America, “and just last month, he said that thinking of China as a competitor is ‘bizarre.’  ” Xi Jinping should be pleased.
Physician: Let’s Talk About Death
In First Things, physician L.S. Dugdale reflects: “With COVID-19 upon us, the threat of mortality is very real, even for the young,” so we need to learn to think and talk about death anew. Yes, hand-washing, social distancing and the like “are necessary measures to safeguard public health,” but they don’t provide the tools to prepare for” death, something traditional peoples are much better at. In practice, that might mean asking the sick and elderly for “their thoughts about ‘breathing tubes’ and mechanical ventilators” (whether they’d want such interventions). More important, “you can promise your presence. You won’t abandon them.”

At least 254,000 Americans have been tested for coronavirus and received results — with more than 30,000 testing positive, Vice President Mike Pence said on Sunday.
The government hopes to have the backlog of tests cleared by the middle of the week, Pence said during a briefing from the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
He urged all commercial labs to prioritize the testing of hospital patients, and said a formal guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services will be issued Monday.
The White House is also encouraging those without symptoms not to get tested, warning that it depletes already scarce supplies of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers.
Asked whether undocumented immigrants can show up to testing sites without fears of being deported, Pence said that Customs and Border Patrol do not target emergency rooms or health clinics “absent certain circumstances.”
President Trump said that “Yes, we will do those tests” since “it’s important that we test that person” regardless of their immigration status.
“The virus doesn’t judge where you are from,” US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said, adding a message to healthcare workers: “We hear you. We hear you. And we are absolutely prioritizing your health and safety.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Dept. of Homeland Security will issue a guidance Monday that if a member of law enforcement is exposed to coronavirus, they can return to work wearing a mask, Pence said.

126,Richard Carranza’s appalling coronavirus hi-jinks should be last straw,https://nypost.com/2020/03/22/richard-carranzas-appalling-coronavirus-hi-jinks-should-be-last-straw/,2020-03-22 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
As low as our expectations for Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza had grown long ago, we’re still appalled at his performance in the face of the coronavirus crisis.
As Susan Edelman reported in Sunday’s Post, Carranza ordered his minions to not report cases of contamination to city health authorities. His March 10 e-mail puts it plainly: “There is no reason for any school to call [the Health Department] to report potential or confirmed cases.”
The excuse was that the lab would independently send a notification — but this was plainly aimed at delaying any action.
Proof of that comes from the shocking refusal last week to take the obvious steps after several educators at Brooklyn Tech tested positive for the COVID-19 bug: The Department of Education still had all 350 staff at one of the city’s largest schools report in for work, even though Mayor Bill de Blasio had closed all schools for students.
This, though the State Education Department on March 9 ordered a complete shutdown of any infected school for at least 24 hours for an investigation of who came into contact with students or staff members with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Nor was Brooklyn Tech the only case where Carranza & Co. ignored that rule: Edelman identified several others, and it’s a good bet other cases exist.
Speculation is rife that this illegal policy was the product of Carranza’s and Mayor de Blasio’s desire to keep the city’s schools open far longer than did neighboring jurisdictions and systems in cities that face a distinctly less grave corona threat.
The mayor and chancellor “say ‘equity and excellence,’ but every other school district closed before you did. You had these kids like Petri dishes spreading this to their families,” one administrator fumed to Edelman.
Another DOE employee said of de Blasio and Carranza: “The blood is on their hands.”
We lost patience with Carranza long ago, as did many if not most of the city’s parents. This development guarantees the hostility of the city’s teachers unions, and pretty much the entire DOE staff.
The chancellor probably doesn’t have the decency to simply resign, but he’d be wise to update his resume, because he’s toast. If de Blasio doesn’t fire him, Gov. Cuomo will have to look seriously at removing the mayor."

Republican Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee on Sunday said they were going into self-quarantine after being exposed to Sen. Rand Paul, who tested positive for the coronavirus.
Both Utah lawmakers said they had been advised by doctors to isolate because of the amount of time they spent in proximity to Paul, of Kentucky, who announced his diagnosis on Sunday.
Romney’s office added that the senator “has no symptoms but will be tested.”
Paul was seen at a GOP senators’ lunch on Friday and swimming in the Senate gym pool on Sunday morning. He is the first known senator to test positive for COVID-19.
Romney and Lee joined colleagues Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who were already self-quarantined for exposure unrelated to Paul.
Asked about his rival, Romney, going into quarantine, President Trump said: “Romney’s in isolation? Gee, that’s too bad.” Trump said he was not being sarcastic.

Sometimes, it takes the total absence of something to see how important it is. Right now, Gotham has its tall buildings, landmarks, parks, theaters, subways. What’s missing is its most important resource: people. No one would choose to learn the lesson in this way, but the coronavirus has highlighted how critical the dense city is — it’s the most efficient way ever devised to bring people together for fun and profit.
Every industry across the city is suffering from the absence of human beings. Broadway. The Met opera. Hotels. Even Central Park’s horse carriages. For a while, at least, Mayor Bill de Blasio will have gotten his wish — no familiar clip-clop of the horses — but it took an event already worse than the Great Depression by some measures to do it.
Restaurants, bars, stores, movies — all in the business of crowds of people. The absence of foot traffic kills street enterprise as well. The vendor who sells newspapers every weekday morning come rain, snow and extreme cold at the entrance to the C/E train in Midtown was out every day last week — but said Friday that he can’t keep it up. No one is taking the train, so no one is walking by his chair.
The people who collect cans out of Central Park’s trash bins to ­redeem the deposits for a living? You can’t do it when there’s no trash in the trash bin.
Even panhandlers: Many of the people who sit outside Manhattan storefronts hoping passersby will drop money in their boxes have vanished.
The novel coronavirus initially harms city workers who interact with the public — and the impact will be huge. Just look at last year’s employment figures.
Leisure and hospitality jobs: 465,000. Save for a skeleton crew delivering food to homebound people, these jobs have vanished overnight. Retail trade: 353,000 jobs. Until last Friday, ­retailers could stay open but weren’t, because no one was walking by.
But the effect on backroom jobs is also huge. With no Broadway, seamstresses in the Garment District are out of work. White-collar workers in industries such as p.r., who can “work at home,” are also suffering the loss of income as customers scale back. The financial sector — with its 473,000 jobs — is unlikely to avoid layoffs.
So what’s the good news? Though predictions already abound that the pandemic spells the end of cities — because who wants to risk pandemic every few years? — it really spells the vitality of cities.
Even as office workers turn to Skype or Microsoft Teams to do their work, the coronavirus proves that this doesn’t work well; workers are unproductive, lonely and anxious. Nobody is excited to replace a concert at Radio City with a live­stream on a puny screen. People prefer to eat out rather than receive a box at their doorstep.
The Internet has its place, but nobody is saying, “Hey, what a great idea it was to make our entire lives virtual; we should have done this before!”
This is good for cities, because there is no other way to recreate a thriving economy.
New York could come out of this in a couple of months, with massive pent-up demand for life as normal. (It will still have its pre-existing problems.) But only if suffering people and small businesses can get back to business quickly once this crisis recedes.
City and state government can do their part. New York should ­declare a moratorium on the sales taxes for small businesses through year’s end, at least.
The city should set up a mediation board so that shuttered businesses can apply for immediate, and decisive, cuts in their rent, rather than force them through a long legal process.
But the city and state will be ­severely constrained in fiscal ­resources. They can’t take on the burden of replacing workers’ and small businesses’ income.
Only Congress can do that.
And Congress has already dithered for too long, and with bizarre ideas: The Senate’s idea to give millions of middle-income workers only $600, because they don’t pay annual income tax, is dumb.
The longer Congress waits, the worst it will get. The task is clear: make the front-line victims of this crisis financially whole by subsidizing lost income with grants, not loans, and do it fast. Repeat until this is over.
New York — and other metropolitan regions — can bounce back quickly. But only with a lot of help, no strings attached. This isn’t a bailout. It’s a rescue.

We are all, all of us, going through various stages of denial where sports are concerned. We are entering Week 3 of our games-free world and we are all here to report that the sun still comes up every morning, it still sets every evening, and every single time they replay the Duke-Kentucky game from 1992, Rick Pitino still doesn’t guard the inbounds pass.
(Perhaps he was distracted by the Iona job 28 years in his future.)
There is a part of us, all of us, that has to beat down the delusional optimist lurking inside. Logically, we know that it’ll be awhile before we see a live sporting event, but even as we start to dream of ordering $12 Heinekens at a ballpark, we turn on the television and there is Gov. Cuomo, saying plainly of COVID-19: “It’s going to work its way through society. But it’s going to be four months, six months, nine months. We’re in that range. Nobody has a crystal ball, no one can tell you.”
Four months. Six months. Nine months.
It’s hard for that potential reality to sink in.
It’s exponentially more fun to see Bill James, the godfather of modern baseball analysis, post on Twitter as he did this weekend: “Pick the day on which you think the major-league baseball season will begin. My pick: May 15.”
(Unless he meant May 15, 2021. That seems more reasonable.)
Of course James, like the rest of us, is a fan. We are allowed our spasms of optimism, even when that bleeds into delusion. There is, after all, nothing rational about living and dying with a hockey team; why should there be anything rational about wanting to SEE a hockey game?
It’s different when you’re talking about the people who run things. We saw a lot of that two weeks ago, when the folks who run sports leagues and basketball tournaments and other such operations came to slow, deliberate and ultimately regret-filled (but proper) decisions to shut things down. The absurdity of that St. John’s-Creighton game going on for a half is something the Big East, specifically commissioner Val Ackerman, will have to answer to in time, when we hold public and private inquests on how all of this went down.
And now there is the International Olympic Committee, which should already have reached the sad conclusion that the upcoming Tokyo Games should be, at least, postponed a year. The U.S. swimming and track and field committees have already called for that. So has a growing number of nations.
Forget the dubious possibility that the world will feel properly scrubbed and sanitized by July 24, when the parade of nations and 11,000 athletes are scheduled to march into Olympic Stadium for the Opening Ceremonies. Let’s say the optimists among us prevail, and we start seeing live sports again sometime in late June or early July.
Even that makes the notion of an on-time start silly. Only 4,000 of those 11,000 athletes have properly qualified for the Games. The trials that would determine the competitors have largely been postponed already, or are certain to be. Travel restrictions are fluid, at best. The Olympics, in optimal times, are a logistical quagmire; amid a global pandemic they would be catastrophic.
Yet the IOC reiterated Sunday that it will wait as long as four weeks before deciding what to do about the Games, with postponement until 2021 the likeliest alternative. And even that concession was only reached after the mounting pressures of local Olympic committees begging the IOC to do the right thing — but before the Canadian and Australian Olympic and Paralympic committees declared they simply won’t send contingents to Tokyo this year, in the strongest show of force — and common sense — yet.
Sometimes, the right thing is simply obvious. It is here. The Olympics, after all, have mostly known their place in world affairs. The 1916 Summer Games were canceled because of World War I, and both the summer and winter games of 1940 and ’44 were canceled due to World War II. The IOC should probably have halted the ’72 Games after terrorists bloodied the Munich Olympiad, but it has had to answer harsh questions about that for 48 years, and rightly so.
Now?
Look, this falls in line with everything else. Everything about our world stinks right now, from our daily small sacrifices (staying home, staying away from friends, honoring quarantines and social distance) to our greater concerns, the workers losing their jobs, the victims felled by this insipid virus, the heroic doctors and nurses and EMTs fighting it on the front lines.
We grapple with these things every day. We bargain in our brains how to cope. It stinks to go through that every day. But we do, all of us, every day. The IOC must do the same, and be quick about it, and smart about it.
Delusion in these times is neither a good strategy nor a good look."

Rudy Gobert gave fans a peek into dealing with the coronavirus, which apparently in his case includes not being able to smell anything.
The Jazz forward, who was the first NBA player to test positive for COVID-19, on Sunday tweeted some of the effects he’s felt while self-quarantining.
“Just to give you guys an update, loss of smell and taste is definitely one of the symptoms, haven’t been able to smell anything for the last 4 days,” Gobert wrote. “Anyone experiencing the same thing?”
According to the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology — which represents ear, nose and throat specialists — the loss of taste and smell could be crucial warning signs in “hidden carriers” of the novel coronavirus, and often appears in patients who show none of the earlier known symptoms.
Gobert tested positive for coronavirus on March 12, which led to the the postponement of Utah’s game against the Thunder and the suspension of the NBA season minutes later.
Nine other NBA players, including Gobert’s teammate Donovan Mitchell, have also tested positive for coronavirus.
Gobert has admitted to being “careless” after touching reporters’ recording devices prior to his positive test and “would have took this thing more seriously.”
Since then, the 27-year-old has publicly urged everyone to take precautionary measures. He also made a $500,000 donation to aid the fight against coronavirus."

An Olympic gold medalist on Sunday said he’d contracted COVID-19 and described the illness as “by far the worst virus I have ever endured.”
Retired South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh, 31, said he has been struggling with the disease for the last 14 days.
“By far the worst virus I have ever endured despite being a healthy individual with strong lungs (no smoking/sport), living a healthy lifestyle and being young (least at risk demographic),” he tweeted.
Although his worst symptoms, like severe fever, have eased, Van der Burgh said he’s still grappling with serious fatigue and an unshakable cough.
“Any physical activity like walking leaves me exhausted for hours,” said the 2012 Olympic 100-meter breaststroke champion.
He addressed athletes specifically, writing, “The loss in body conditioning has been immense and [I] can only feel for the athletes that contract Covid-19 as they will suffer a great loss of current conditioning through the last training cycle.”
“Athletes will continue to train as there is no clarification re summer Games and thus are exposing themselves to unnecessary risk,” wrote Van der Burgh, who retired in 2018.
“And those that do contract will try rush back to training most likely enhancing/extending the damage/recovery time,” he added.
“Please, look after yourself everyone! Health comes first – COVID-19 is no joke!”

It’s the final nail in the coffin.
An increasing number of mourners are choosing to skip paying their respects to the dead in person amid the coronavirus pandemic, instead opting to participate in virtual send-offs, funeral directors told The Post.
“It’s a terrifying time,’’ said Queens funeral director Irene Elcock. “We have to turn around and think about keeping everyone safe.’’
While New York state says funerals can still be held with “immediate family’’ attending — even after Sunday’s 8 p.m. ban on all “non-essential’’ gatherings — it is not specific on the number of people allowed.
Funeral homes “should postpone services when possible,’’ according to an edict from Gov. Cuomo’s office. Otherwise, they “should limit the size of any services or gatherings to as few participants as possible (e.g. immediate family.”
Elcock said her funeral home is allowing up to 10 people if a family chooses to hold a service offline, which is in keeping with the CDC’s recommended guideline for gatherings.
She said her Elcock Funeral Home held its first live-streamed service last week, and it drew about 15 people on-site — and many more virtually.
Elcock said one reason her mortuary is still holding in-person services is only because “the ability to see the person and know they are dead is different than trying to convince yourself they are dead.”
Still, “We might put extra measures in place and put netting over the casket to make sure people don’t touch the body and just to get some distance, because you just don’t know,’’ she said.
Funeral director Jonathan Green of Fairfield, Conn., said the situation may get to the point where even rabbis at his services stay home.
The religious are currently presiding over services in person, even if it is a virtual funeral.
Green said some rabbis are particularly worried because they are home with their children and concerned about infecting their families.
Of the recent live-streamed services from his Abraham L. Green and Son Funeral Home, the funeral director said, “I think it’s a comfort and stress relief for the families who lost someone who don’t have to worry about how to join if they have restrictions or health concerns.
“Services are happening,’’ Green said. “They’re just a little bit different right now.’’
But the working stiffs who handle the bodies can’t seem to escape worry.
“We were told how to protect ourselves, but we have not been given anything necessarily concrete on how long that virus lasts on the host,’’ Elcock said, noting that workers wear masks and gloves.
The CDC only says that “most often,’’ the virus is transmitted by coughing or sneezing and notes that this transmission isn’t a concern when handling remains.
But “much is unknown about COVID-19,’’ its Web site says.
“Some cemeteries are not letting people out of cars, or people have to wait for grave workers to complete their work, before they can visit,’’ Elcock said amid concerns of the spread.
“Everyone has a family,’’ she said."

A Florida man diagnosed with coronavirus claims he was saved from certain death by an anti-malaria drug touted as a possible treatment by President Trump.
Rio Giardinieri, 52, told Los Angeles’ Fox 11 that he struggled with horrendous back pain, headaches, cough and fatigue for five days after catching COVID-19, possibly at a conference in New York.
Doctors at the Memorial Regional Hospital in South Florida diagnosed him with the coronavirus and pneumonia and put him on oxygen in the ICU, he told the outlet.
After more than a week, doctors told him there was nothing more they could do and, on Friday evening, Giardinieri said goodbye to his wife and three children.
“I was at the point where I was barely able to speak and breathing was very challenging,” Giardinieri said. “I really thought my end was there.”
Then a friend sent him a recent article about hydroxychloroquine, a prescription drug that’s been used to treat malaria for decades and auto-immune diseases like lupus.
Overseas studies have found it to be promising as a treatment for COVID-19, though it hasn’t been approved by health officials.
Trump last week said he was instructing the FDA to fast-track testing of hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine, as treatment for COVID-19.
Giardinieri said he contacted an infectious disease doctor about the drug.
“He gave me all the reasons why I would probably not want to try it because there are no trials, there’s no testing, it was not something that was approved,” said Giardinieri.
“And I said, ‘Look, I don’t know if I’m going to make it until the morning,’ because at that point I really thought I was coming to the end because I couldn’t breathe anymore,” Giardinieri continued.
“He agreed and authorized the use of it and 30 minutes later the nurse gave it to me.”
After about an hour after taking the pills, Giardinieri said, it felt like his heart was beating out of his chest and, about two hours later, he had another episode where he couldn’t breathe.
He says he was given Benadryl and some other drugs and that when he woke up around 4:45 a.m., it was “like nothing ever happened.”
He’s since had no fever or pain and can breathe again. Giardinieri said doctors believe the episodes he experienced were not a reaction to the medicine but his body fighting off the virus.
Giardinieri, the vice president of a company that manufactures cooking equipment for high-end restaurants in Los Angeles, said he had three doses of the medicine Saturday and is hoping to be discharged from the hospital in five days.
“To me, there was no doubt in mind that I wouldn’t make it until morning,” said Giardinieri. “So to me, the drug saved my life.”"
134,Jarrett Allen’s status with Nets has never been more unclear,https://nypost.com/2020/03/22/jarrett-allens-status-with-nets-has-never-been-more-unclear/,2020-03-22 00:00:00,"Part I of a new series analyzing the Brooklyn Nets.
When the coronavirus pandemic suspended the NBA season, it was still a little unclear exactly what Jarrett Allen is, and what he will become.
Long-term center or deposed starter?
Foundation piece or trade chip?
Homegrown Net or casualty of Brooklyn’s new order?
With COVID-19, these are confusing times for everybody. But Allen’s status with the Nets is more up in the air than it has been in years. First he lost his form, then one of his biggest backers when the Nets parted ways with coach Kenny Atkinson.
Then he lost his starting job, replaced by DeAndre Jordan. And with the latter seen as a package deal with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, it begs the question of whether that leaves Allen as a valuable reserve next season — or as a valuable trade chip.
When the Nets parted ways with Atkinson on March 7, among speculation about the reasons why was Atkinson’s insistence on starting Allen over Jordan.
Allen’s form dipped, a team-worst minus-49 over the last eight games. Atkinson eventually cut his playing time, and — at his final game as Nets coach — spoke with The Post about the idea of giving Durant minutes as a small-ball center next season.
“No problem. If he’s going against a big strong guy, [maybe not]; but then you have to come out and guard him,” Atkinson told The Post. “Teams are realizing. You just have to understand that advantage.”
Atkinson won’t get that chance, replaced by assistant Jacque Vaughn. And Vaughn’s first personnel decision as interim coach was to replace Allen in the lineup with Jordan, a decade older but not only in better form but also close with Durant and Irving.
The Nets only played two games with Vaughn in charge before the coronavirus pandemic suspended the season. They won both with Allen coming off the bench.
 

They beat Chicago with Allen a minus-7 in 19 minutes off the bench, and Jordan a plus-12. Then they earned an impressive win in Los Angeles against the Lakers with Allen mustering just three points — his second-lowest outing of the season — while Jordan ripped down 12 rebounds.
Vaughn framed it as a tactical move to shore up the first-unit defense and get a quick floor-running second unit, adding, “it gave both those guys a drive to give us their best.”
Admittedly, keeping Allen driven has been a thing for the Nets. Even Spencer Dinwiddie said a dialed-in Allen is “totally different. … When he comes with that aggressiveness, he shows [top 5] type of talent.”
But make no mistake, Vaughn is an interim who wants the job full-time. The best way to do that is by finding the starting five that best accentuates Durant and Irving, basketball-wise and chemistry-wise.

If 6-foot-11 rookie Nic Claxton develops as expected, and Durant sees time as a rim-protecting stretch five — his 1.8 blocks in 2017-18 far exceed Allen’s career-high — it could leave either Jordan or Allen superfluous. And it strains credulity to think Jordan is going anywhere.
Yes, the Nets picked up Allen’s option for next season on Oct. 14 and they reportedly turned down an offer for him that would’ve netted Clint Capela. But they may look to add a third star this summer. With Irving and Caris LeVert’s health history, dealing Dinwiddie may be more risky than cashing in on Allen.

An 88-year-old Holocaust survivor suffering from coronavirus reportedly became the first person in Israel to die from the illness.
Arie Even, who immigrated to Israel from Hungary in 1949, contracted the virus while staying in an assisted living facility where several of the residents have tested positive for COVID-19, according to Haaretz.
“He was a beloved and dear man, lived a full life, was dedicated to his family, and showed strength until his very last moments,” his son said in a statement to the newspaper.
“We lament that he had to spend his last moment without his family by his side. We would like to thank the medical staff at Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Medical Center for their devoted treatment and the empathy they demonstrated.”
Even died after going into cardiac arrest at Shaare Zedek Medical Center on Saturday. He had been transported there in critical condition about a week earlier.
More than 1,200 people have contracted the virus in Israel, with about two dozen listed in critical condition.
The illness has infected 329,000 people worldwide. At least 14,500 people have died."

Chilling scenes have emerged from hospitals in Madrid, Spain, that have been overrun by coronavirus patients — showing some sprawled out over the floor.
The Severo Ochoa de Leganes Hospital has been particularly hard hit by the onslaught and collapsed under the pressure on Thursday, according to local media outlet Larazon.
One elderly patient with symptoms of the illness decided to leave the packed emergency room and head over to a bank to withdraw money so he could find room in a private facility, the news site reported.
Several patients have spent as many as three days sitting in the ER waiting room to await beds that only become available when those admitted either die or recover and are sent home.
There were more than 9,700 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the capital city as of the last tally.
On Sunday, Spain recorded close to 400 new fatalities, bringing the total to 1,720, suggesting that the national lockdown was failing to be effective.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he would ask parliament to extend a 15-day state of emergency — which bars people from leaving their homes unless absolutely necessary — until April 11.
Meanwhile, patients also could be seen lying on the floor at the Infanta Leonor Hospital in Madrid, according to Newsflash.
Jorge Mora, a spokesman for the health care union SATSE, said the hospital was “at maximum capacity,” with more than 500 patients admitted for COVID 19 — 300 confirmed cases and 230 under observation."
137,Trump nixes NYC-area coronavirus quarantine that had governors in tailspin,https://nypost.com/2020/03/29/trump-nixes-nyc-area-coronavirus-quarantine-that-had-governors-in-tailspin/,2020-03-29 00:00:00,"President Trump on Saturday night backed off a daylong threat to lock down New York City and the tristate area — a proposal that had thrown three governors for a loop, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who likened the plan to starting a “civil war.”
“A quarantine will not be necessary,” Trump wrote in a series of tweets ­Saturday night, reasoning that a travel advisory would suffice.
And the travel advisory was merely a tepidly-worded announcement, sans teeth, buried in the CDC website.
“The CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately,” it said.
The advisory stated it does not apply to such critical industries as trucking, public health, banking and food supply.
Trump had said earlier Saturday that he was considering imposing an “enforced” two-week quarantine and travel ban on New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut in hopes of protecting the rest of the nation from the epicenter of the outbreak.
“We’d like to see New York quarantined because it’s a hot spot,” he said in a surprise announcement that blindsided Cuomo — who ripped the idea as “a Civil War kind of discussion.”The Washington Post via Getty Images
“This would be a declaration of war on states,” the governor said on CNN.
“If you start walling off areas all across the country, it would just be ­totally bizarre, counter-productive, anti-America, anti-social,” he said.
“We would be Wuhan, China, and that doesn’t make any sense.”
“We don’t have any details and aren’t sure what the president means by his comment,” a City Hall spokesperson weighed in.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said they, too, had not been consulted by the White House.
“Confusion leads to panic,” Lamont said.
The potential ring-around-the-epicenter had loomed as the pandemic’s toll continued its alarming rise.
Data released Saturday show the death rate from the coronavirus sharply accelerating in the Big Apple, with one person dying every six minutes in the 24 hours ending 4 p.m. Saturday.
At least 222 more people died in those 24 hours from COVID-19, bringing the death toll for the city to 672, with some 30,000 testing positive.
State and national numbers were also grim.
More than 700 are dead statewide, and more than 1,700 are on ventilators, the vast majority in city ICUs.
The United States remained the pandemic’s hardest-hit country, with more than 119,000 cases and some 2,000 deaths.
Those 2,000 deaths represent a two-day doubling in the death toll.
Trump had divulged virtually no details of his proposed lockdown, except to say it would exempt delivery trucks and vital personnel.
Even so, it would have been the biggest federal health quarantine since the Spanish-flu pandemic of 1918-19, ­according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“I’d rather not, but we may need it,” Trump had warned.
“New York, New Jersey, maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut, quarantined.”
The president spoke as he prepared to board his Marine One helicopter en route to Norfolk, Va. — where he oversaw the departure of the USNS Comfort hospital ship set to steam all day Sunday toward New York Harbor.
In threatening a lockdown, Trump singled out the risk to Florida, where state officials last Monday ordered fleeing New Yorkers to keep out or observe a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon ­arrival.
All incoming planes from the tristate area are being boarded by law-enforcement and state health officials under order of Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Governors in other states, including Maryland, Texas, South Carolina and Rhode Island, have issued similar keep-out-or-quarantine ­orders for fleeing New Yorkers.
But Trump’s tristate lockdown would have been the first quarantine to be federally mandated.
“They’re having problems down in Florida, a lot of New Yorkers ­going down. We don’t want that,” he said.
He doubled down later in the afternoon on a tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base, calling a potential quarantine of New York, New Jersey and at least parts of Connecticut “short term, two weeks.”
“Restrict travel,” he said, adding he has been in talks with DeSantis.
“This would be an enforceable quarantine. And you know, I’d rather not do it, but we may need it.”
Eight hours passed with Trump issuing no further clarifications on what the lockdown would entail, or how it would be enforced.
Neither did the White House.
“We are evaluating those options now,” Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters vaguely.
Sen. Chuck Schumer said he, too, was in the dark.
“All decisions must be made based on facts, science and the best advice from our public health professionals — and it must be done in close coordination with our local and state officials. I implore the president to work with New York officials, follow the experts and make evidence-based decisions.”
The president would have been within his rights to issue an executive order mandating a quarantine in cases of communicable-disease outbreaks, including “flu that can cause pandemic,” according to the CDC.
Breaking a federal quarantine order could be punishable by fines and imprisonment, the CDC says.
Trump and Cuomo have not been totally at odds. Earlier Saturday, Cuomo noted with gratitude that the president had approved the opening of four new 1,000-bed sites for coronavirus treatment.
Also Saturday, Cuomo announced that the state’s presidential primary, previously scheduled for April 28, will now take place June 23, to coincide with that date’s congressional and legislative primaries.
Meanwhile, about 30 nurses and their relatives protested a shortage of masks and gloves in front of Jacobi Hospital’s emergency room in the Bronx, and demanded that the government provide protective equipment immediately.
The nurses stood six feet apart, holding signs reading “Health are before Profits,” “Respect Public Healthcare Nurses” and “We Risk Our Lives to Save Yours.”
Reaction to the threatened federal lockdown was mixed for New Yorkers, who since last Sunday have been coping with a state mandate that bars group gatherings and closes most businesses but does not prohibit residents from traveling into and out of the state.
“Trump wanting to close off the tristate area is, of course, disconcerting due to his history with walls and disdain for the state,” said out-of-work bartender Camille Larkins, 23, of Bedford-Stuy­vesant.
“But the state of corona in New York right now is not good. We will never flatten the curve if we don’t contain and handle the ­problem.”

138,Why the travel industry will be stronger and better after coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/03/29/why-the-travel-industry-will-be-stronger-and-better-after-coronavirus/,2020-03-29 00:00:00,"The travel industry has been decimated by the coronavirus — with estimates of over $24 billion lost as 825,000 jobs have been wiped out and more than 8.2 million visitors stay away from the United States alone.
But with the storm clouds come a silver lining. Without the steady stream of cruise ships (some of the worst polluters in the world), the canals of Venice have become clear for the first time in centuries; pollution around the world has dropped dramatically and cities that had been trampled by overtourism are recovering.
And travel experts say that when the world recovers from the rampant spread of COVID-19, the industry will come back stronger than ever. And when the world starts moving again, it will be in the right way.
“I think when this has finally come under control it will create a huge need to travel,” said Samantha Brown, who hosts “Places to Love” on PBS. “And I’m not talking just travel to far places … but small trips to more local and state destinations. We will want to move and most importantly reconnect to people.”
Pavia Rosati, who founded the travel site Fathom, agreed and said there will likely be an “increased interest in local travel, for those who want to stay relatively close to home. This might be the year that New Yorkers who usually go to Greece make their way to Nantucket or the Gullah Islands instead.”
Wherever people go, there is sure to be a sense of “mindfulness and appreciation for the local people and vibrant tapestries of cultures for the destinations we visit,” according to Tom Marchant, co-founder of luxury travel operator Black Tomato. “After weeks and perhaps months staying home, this longing for authentic human connection and togetherness will be stronger than ever … but there will be less of a cookie-cutter travel mentality.”
While cruise ships will always trundle on, Rosati hopes cities will cut down on mega, mass tourism, specifically in places like Venice.
“The Italian government need(s) to start restricting the number of visitors allowed into the city daily,” she said. “And probably do a better job of restricting — or even banning — the floating-mall-sized cruise ships that disgorge tens of thousands of people into the city, making its narrow streets un-passable for Venetians who are just trying to get home from work. If this unwanted forced reset helps us get smarter about our limited resources, and be a little less selfish about how we behave when we go out into the world, we will come out of this crisis in a better place.”
As the travel industry recovers, travel options will be more limited than before the virus struck. Smaller destinations will likely not be as easily accessible.
“One upside is that people will not take for granted the ease of travel and the freedom to explore so many places,” said Melissa Biggs Bradley, CEO and Founder of Indagare, a boutique travel planning company. “There will be less over-tourism, but that is also going to be a consequence of fewer travel options, which will have shrunk when we come out of this. There is no way that you will have the quantity of flights or the range of flights when travel comes back. I doubt that the smaller regional areas are going to have the same kind of flight lift that they had in early 2020 for another 10 years. Airlines everywhere have been decimated and they are going to cut routes and many of the hotels and businesses that existed because of arriving tourists are going to disappear.”
The limitations will help protect travel destinations from what Bradley calls “fast tourism.”
“Like fast food, quick travel that is not really nourishing or supportive of local communities,” she explained.
Travel industry experts hope that the spread of COVID-19 will make travelers more aware of their surroundings, with “clean” countries winning out.
“Once this pandemic is behind us, big cities that were suffering under the weight of wall-to-wall tourist crowds will likely see fewer and smaller groups of travelers for a few years,” added Wendy Perrin, who established the Trusted Travel Expert’s list.
“Poor, rural communities that were devastated by the pandemic will probably see more donations from philanthropic-minded travelers who visit these villages and want to help. And countries such as Singapore and South Korea that implemented successful public-health responses to the coronavirus will likely attract more tourists than before, as these countries will be viewed as relatively safe and clean.”

Since 1988, Damon Oppenheimer has been scouting high school and college baseball players while married to the same routine of flying or driving to evaluate players and then repeating the process in the next town.
This year the Yankees’ VP of domestic amateur scouting has another challenge in front of him: There are players eligible for the draft who haven’t played a game this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Yes, Yankees scouts saw players last summer and in the fall’s showcase circuit, but not laying eyes on a high school senior makes the evaluation incomplete.
“It really makes it more of a challenge,’’ Oppenheimer said of being unable to get an in-depth look at players. “You haven’t seen the player. Did he get stronger? It makes it hard. It’s a little bit of a challenge.’’
While Oppenheimer, who is in his 28th year with the Yankees, and his scouts saw college players before games were shut down, they might have to sort through information on players to make a pick with conviction.
“Rely on quality information and work with that,’’ Oppenheimer said.
There is hope among the scouting community that even if colleges and high schools don’t resume play, there will be an avenue to get a live look at players before the draft, which was originally scheduled for July 10-12 but will be held sometime before July 21 and likely will be five to 10 rounds.
“I think there will be stuff set up. I am not sure who will set it up, maybe private, MLB or USA Baseball,’’ said Oppenheimer, whose club picks 28th. “In Southern California and Florida, high school kids and college kids, they have been seen.’’

While all 30 big league organizations are in the same situation, a key ingredient in evaluating players from other areas might be how diligent the scouts were last summer and fall when players participated in college leagues and showcases.
“We didn’t shut it down. We saw the northern kids all through the summer,’’ Oppenheimer said.
A year ago the Yankees were very familiar with Anthony Volpe, a shortstop out of Delbarton School in Morristown, N.J., because of what they saw the summer before his senior year.
“He opened our eyes in the summer and continued to do that at Jupiter [Fla.] during the winter,’’ Oppenheimer said of Volpe, who was the Yankees’ first-round pick (30th overall) last year and signed for a $2.7 million deal instead of going to Vanderbilt.
Still, the Yankees stayed connected with Volpe during the 2019 high school season.
Oppenheimer instructed his scouts to use the down time to finish player reports.
“Write up anybody you had interest in and hadn’t completed,’’ Oppenheimer said of his message.
As for getting to communicate with players in which teams are interested, it is possible MLB will allow that to happen via Skype and phone calls. That is far from usual, but these aren’t usual times."

WESTERLY, RI — The Rhode Island National Guard started going door to door on Saturday in coastal areas to inform any New Yorkers who may have come to the state that they must self-quarantine for 14 days while Gov. Gina Raimondo expanded the mandatory self-quarantine to anyone visiting the state.
Raimondo also ordered residents to stay at home, with exceptions for getting food, medicines or going to the doctor, and ordered nonessential retail businesses to close Monday until April 13 to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. She also directed realtors and hotel operators to include new requirements that any out-of-state residents must quarantine for 14 days in their purchase agreements.
State Police set up a checkpoint on I-95 in Hope Valley on Friday where drivers with New York license plates must stop and provide contact information and were told to self-quarantine for two weeks, WPRI.com reported.
If New Yorkers don’t comply, they face fines and jail time, Raimondo said, adding that that’s not the goal.
“I want to be crystal clear about this: If you’re coming to Rhode Island from New York you are ordered into quarantine. The reason for that is because more than half of the cases of coronavirus in America are in New York,” Raimondo said, adding that it’s not meant to be discriminatory.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the order “reactionary” and unconstitutional, saying he’d sue Rhode Island if the policy isn’t rescinded but believed they could “work it out.”
“I understand the goal … but there’s a point of absurdity, and I think what Rhode Island did is at that point of absurdity,” said Cuomo, a Democrat. “We have to keep the ideas and the policies we implement positive rather than reactionary and emotional.”
President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had spoken with some governors and was considering some type of a quarantine to prevent people in New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut from traveling. Trump Late Saturday, though, he tweeted that a travel advisory should be administered and not a quarantine.
Trump told reporters at the White House that it would be for a “short period of time, if we do it at all.” He said he had spoken with Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., and Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., the country’s epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbot on Thursday joined other states in imposing quarantines on air travelers from the New York area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and New Orleans, two places where COVID-19 outbreak is more severe. The Republican said travelers who don’t comply with the 14-day quarantine risk jail time, adding that state troopers would conduct visits to make sure people were staying put.
In Rhode Island, which reported its first two deaths from COVID-19 on Saturday, a team of a Westerly police officer and a Guard member were visiting stately and modest coastal homes in the Westerly neighborhood of Watch Hill collecting contact information from New Yorkers and telling them to self-quarantine. They expected to go to about 1,000 homes over a few days.
“This is more of an education tool to make people aware and comply with what we are asking them to do,” said Westerly, Rhode Island, police chief Shawn Lacey. “We are certainly hope it doesn’t get to enforcement action that has to happen.”
Reha Kocatas, a New Yorker who arrived March 22 from the Bahamas to his Rhode Island home, said his wife and two children were visited by a police officer and a national guardsmen. Already under a 14-day quarantine per a state order because he had arrived from outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Kocatas said he volunteered information to the authorities including the number of people in the home, when they entered Rhode Island and his and his wife’s date of birth.
But he questioned why it was necessary to send a police officer to his door.
“It seemed like a pretty large waste of resources for something that could have been volunteered through an online form pretty quickly,” he said.
“If New Yorkers are such high risk individuals, why are we putting first responders in front of these individuals is a little questionable since there is no action item at the end of the day,” he continued. “They weren’t going to remove us. It seemed like bureaucratic grandstanding. The local community that happens to be here believes that it’s a waste of precious resources when time is the essence in preparing for other things.”
Ramaindo said only an estimated 50% of Rhode Islanders are complying with social distancing, with crowds spotted at a beach, groups at parks, crowds at big box stores and house parties. As a result, she banned gatherings of more than five people and urged people to limit interactions to the same five.
For those who are not complying with social distancing: “I’ve said it last week, I’m going to say it again, knock if off. You are risking the lives of everyone in this state,” she said.
People able to work from home must do so, she said. Residents who work in Massachusetts and must go to work, must self-quarantine after work at home, she said.
For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death."

At least 50 doctors have died from COVID-19 while trying to help the sick in Italy — having been sent “unarmed” to fight a “war” without essential protective supplies, their association claimed.
Italy’s National Federation of Orders of Surgeons and Dentists (FNOMCeO) released a list of names of the dead doctors amid a blistering attack on the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) available.
“The dead do not make a noise. Yet, the names of our dead friends, our colleagues, put here in black and white, make a deafening noise,” the association’s president, Filippo Anelli, said in a statement reported by The Independent.
Italy has become the epicenter of the contagion in Europe — now surpassed only by the US in the rest of the world — and has seen more than 10,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 17 of the dead doctors were in Bergamo, the city in Lombardy with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, the Independent said.
Anelli — who wrote a letter of complaint to President Maurizio Fugatti — insisted the deaths were a result of Italian doctors being sent to the “war” against coronavirus “unarmed,” with many reportedly only equipped with masks, scrubs, gloves and hairnets.
“It is reasonable to assume that these events would have been largely avoidable if health workers had been correctly informed and equipped with sufficient adequate PPE: masks, gloves, disposable gowns, protective visors,” Anelli said, according to the report.
Instead, they “continue to be in short supply or to be supplied in an unacceptable way in the midst of an epidemic to which even Italy had declared itself ready only up to two months ago.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned about the threat of limited PPE supplies.
“The chronic, global shortage of personal protective equipment is one of the most urgent threats to our collective ability to save lives,” director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, according to the report.
“When health workers are at risk, we’re all at risk,” he warned."

The mayor on CNN’s “State of the Union” was confronted with a series of clips of him calmly insisting Big Apple residents should carry on with their regular lives, with the last just two weeks ago on March 13.
Interviewer Jake Tapper asked bluntly, “In retrospect, is that message at least in part to blame for how rapidly the virus has spread across the city?”
“Jake, we should not be focusing, in my view, on anything looking back,” Hizzoner insisted, saying he was “just working with the information” at the moment and trying to avoid panic.
“This is just about how we save lives going forward,” he said. “This was a very different world just a short time ago.”
De Blasio was then challenged over whether he was hypocritical in making similar complaints against President Trump.
“Mr. Mayor, weren’t your actions in this outbreak also far, far behind the curve?” Tapper asked.
De Blasio admitted it was a “fair” question, but blamed the lack of testing for giving a false picture of how urgent the crisis would be in the Big Apple.
“I think the big historical point here that will be looked back on is if this country had the testing we needed this could have been a very different reality,” he insisted.
“But there’s no time to go back over that. There’s only time to get through this next week and the week after that.”
He said the time to deal with the question was “after this war is over.”

Couples began scrambling to set up births at their own abodes after hospitals last week banned all visitors — including spouses, partners and family members — from entering maternity and postpartum rooms to prevent the spread of the virus.
Gov. Cuomo then lifted the bans on Saturday.
“People got worried,” said Evelyn Alvarez, a Bronx-based doula. “Women are suddenly interested in alternative births because they don’t want to be alone.”
But there are only about 25 midwives certified to do home births citywide, according to industry sources and nyhomebirth.com — forcing midwives to turn many away couples.
The effect on moms-to-be is “heartbreaking,” Sun said.
“The birth world is in turmoil,” she said. “I worry about what this will mean for babies being born to mothers who are so stressed.
“I don’t want to send people away, but this is unprecedented,” Sun said. “We’ve never had to deal with anything like this. It’s really bad.”
Meanwhile, as home births boom, many midwives are in desperate in need of protective medical gear, Sun said, noting that the pandemic has sucked suppliers dry.
A change.org petition is now demanding that Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo force all hospitals to allow pregnant women to bring along “a spouse, partner or other person.”
The petition says state health guidelines have “determined a support person … is essential to care for the patient during labor.”
The petition had garnered more than 600,000 signatures by Sunday.
To help solo mom-to-be in hospitals, some doulas have “started offering virtual support,” Alvarez said. “Midwives are tapped.”
Hospitals with the no-visitors policy include the Mount Sinai Health System, which operates eight hospitals in New York City and Long Island, and NewYork-Presbyterian, which has 13 locations in the five boroughs and Westchester County."

Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, warned Sunday that every city could be hit as hard as New York City as the virus continues to rage across the country.
“Every metro area should assume that they could have an outbreak equivalent to New York and do everything right now to prevent it,” Birx said on “Meet the Press.”
Birx called on leaders from every region to start preparing for major outbreaks, saying that it will be too late to contain once cases start reaching hospitals.
“No state, no metro area will be spared, and the sooner we react and the sooner the states and the metro areas react and ensure that they put in full mitigation, at the same time understanding exactly what their hospitals need, then we’ll be able to move forward together and protect the most Americans,” Birx said.
But Birx urged city dwellers not to try and flee once the virus starts spreading in their region.
“What we’re trying to say to everyone is ‘when this virus comes to your metro area, please stay in your metro area where your care can be provided,’ because it’s spreading virus more quickly around the United States,” she said.
The Big Apple reported more than 30,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Saturday afternoon, including 672 deaths, the city health department said.
Meanwhile, across the country, there have been at least 124,000 cases with more than 2,100 deaths, according to figures from John Hopkins University."

Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert on the White House task force, offered a dire prediction on Sunday — saying that the coronavirus pandemic could infect more than a million Americans and kill up to 200,000.
“Looking at what we’re seeing now, I would say between 100,000 and 200,000 [deaths] … I mean, we’re going to have millions of cases,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
Still, Fauci cautioned that the numbers based on different models are a “moving target.”
He said the models are based on “assumptions” and give a “worst-case scenario and a best-case scenario.”
“Generally, the reality is somewhere in the middle. I have never seen a model of the diseases that I have dealt where the worst-case scenario actually came out. They always overshoot,” Fauci said.
“So, when you use numbers like a million, a million-and-a-half, two million, that almost certainly is off the chart. Now, it’s not impossible, but very, very unlikely.”
The coronavirus pandemic, which initially began in China in December, has rapidly spread around the globe.

The 50-year-old lawyer who was the coronavirus ‘patient zero’ in Westchester has been discharged from the hospital, Gov. Andrew Cuomo revealed Sunday.
Lawrence Garbuz — who was revealed on March 2 to be the first-known carrier in New Rochelle, where the contagion quickly spread — had been so sick he was in a medically induced coma earlier this month.
“The ‘patient zero’ — what we call patient zero in Westchester, New Rochelle — who was very sick for a very long time, he has actually gone home,” Cuomo revealed at his press conference in Albany.
“He’s out of the hospital,” the governor said, offering no further details.
Cuomo hailed the news as an example of the “dramatic trendline” of people fully recovering from COVID-19 and being discharged.
“Now you’re seeing the discharge number trend way up,” he said.
Garbuz — who rode the Metro-North train to get to his Manhattan law firm — hadn’t traveled to any coronavirus hotspot countries and likely contracted the virus from someone locally.
It quickly spread among dozens in his community, prompting the mile-radius coronavirus “containment zone” centered on the family’s synagogue.
Cuomo on Sunday used it as an example of how “beautiful” religious gatherings have “made many, many people ill.”"
150,Coronavirus is providing the course correction kids desperately needed,https://nypost.com/2020/03/29/coronavirus-is-providing-the-course-correction-kids-desperately-needed/,2020-03-29 00:00:00,"Silver linings are hard to come by, but maybe this could be one.
With the cataclysmic coronavirus upon us, it is just the tiniest bit possible that, in terms of child development, something good could come of it: A way to press the reset button on child anxiety. Yes, even during — and precisely because we are in — these insanely anxious times.
Before the virus changed everything, childhood anxiety was one of the worst things facing today’s kids.
Over the past several decades, the rates were spiking to the point where today, according to the National Institutes of Health, nearly one in three adolescents has an anxiety disorder. Pre-COVID we were hearing stories about students too scared to even put their name on a quiz without precise teacher instructions.
“Do you want our full name or just our first name? Do we have to write the date?” Kids had gotten so used to micromanagement they’d come to crave it. They were terrified of screwing up.
Being driven to school, supervised on playdates and participating in a boatload of adult-run extracurriculars meant that many kids just didn’t have much chance to gain the confidence that comes from actually making something happen, or handling some roadblocks. Across the economic spectrum, parents were trying to make their kids’ lives perfect — and accidentally depriving them of the chance to punch through some problems on their own. And grow up in the process.
What would it take to reverse this trend?
Ahem.
School closings and the cancellation of almost every last clarinet lesson have left households in a tizzy. The moms on social media sound like they’re feeding vocabulary packets to the dog and splashing the Frosted Flakes with vodka.
So while obviously the parents are right there on top of the kids (not to mention worried out of their minds), they are not right there to organize 15.7 hours of structured activity each day. Nobody can do that. Instead, these days are crazily free-form — ironically more free, under lockdown, than many kids have ever been.
Thrown from the soccer-Kumon continuum, kids are starting to do all the things they didn’t have time to do or weren’t trusted to do before. We’re already hearing about marathon Lego sessions, cookie baking, sibling-sitting and the videos kids are making in their unleashed time.
During the regular school year, which feels like a lifetime ago, our non-profit encourages schools do the Let Grow Project, where kids take home the assignment, “Do something new, on your own, without your parents.”
We’ve watched kids blossom like crazy once they were nudged into simply making pancakes, or riding their bikes. One middle-schooler told his teacher that thanks to doing a bunch of new things on his own, he was no longer taking his anxiety meds.
Amazing. Now, with a whole country’s worth of kids at home and school only taking up a fraction of the long, long day, it’s a whole new (indoor, trophy-free, child-organized) ballgame.
As for parents worried that all this non-academic time is dooming their kids’ futures, research at the University of Colorado at Boulder found that the kids who have more free time to create and structure their own activities develop stronger executive functioning skills — that is, better planning, problem-solving and follow-through — than kids whose lives are more continuously structured by adults.
Executive functioning skills are exactly what kids need to succeed at school and in real life (that thing we used to partake in, before Zoom).
When disruption occurs, learning is inevitable. It’s the same reason we’re all suddenly experts on viruses, curve-flattening and Italian geography. We are alert because we’re in new territory — a whole new world we have to navigate.
The kids are navigating, too, solving new problems, adapting (not like angels, but like growing humans) and muscling through, because they have no choice.
Childhood needed a course correction. In a million trillion years, this is not how we would have wanted it to happen.
Nonetheless, here goes.

British boxer Anthony Yarde said his father has died after contracting coronavirus.
“My dad passed away from this virus yesterday,” the 28-year-old wrote Saturday on his Instagram story. “He was fit with no health issues.”
Yarde, one of the world’s top light-heavyweight boxers, said he hopes to use his personal experience as a wake-up call for others to quarantine at home amid the COVID-19 outbreak, which has claimed over 30,000 lives worldwide.
“The more people go out and mingle the longer this isolation will last and the more it will spread,” Yarde wrote.
“I’m not a doctor but I do know if you stay home you are less likely to catch it and pass it on,” he continued. “It’s seriously not worth the risk.”
As of Sunday afternoon, over 19,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK.
Yarde was slated to fight in London next month before the event was postponed, according to The Independent."

Nearly one-third of food pantries in the five boroughs have already shut down as they struggle to feed the growing number of New Yorkers left jobless by the COVID-19 bug that has shuttered thousands of businesses.
The rest now face elimination unless the state approves a $25 million lifeline, according to nonprofits that provide food pantries.
“There is a tsunami of further needs that is coming,” David Greenfield, CEO of the Met Council, told The Post. “In most neighborhoods, you only have one food pantry. Once that food pantry is closed, it shutters that lifeline to all the needy people in the neighborhood.”
He said the pantries are dealing with a “triple whammy.”
The pantries said they are being forced to pay significantly higher prices for food as the demand for goods skyrockets — Greenfield said the cost of basics like eggs have gone up 180 percent.
Meanwhile, the pantries find themselves short-staffed, in some cases with more than half of pantry workers out sick. That has forced the charities to spend crucial dollars to buy protective gear for their remaining staff.
“People don’t have enough to pay bills, let alone put food on the table,” said Jilly Stephens, CEO of City Harvest. “Food is considered an elastic expense. People will seek out a food pantry, people who are doing everything right, have jobs, sending children to school.”
“On top of that, tens of thousands of New Yorkers are losing jobs very abruptly,” Stephens said. “In the last couple of weeks, we start to see new people in line. A lot of new faces, a lot of young faces.”
“Food is essential,” she said. “When there’s no food it’s a significant problem for us — as individuals, as a community, as a city, a state, a country.”
Meanwhile, Greenfield said the coronavirus crisis has forced them to do more with dwindling resources, with the nonprofits pushing out 30 to 50 percent more food to meet the growing demand.
The call for help comes just days after City Council Speaker Corey Johnson called on Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo to commit $50 million in emergency aid to the pantries — but it has yet to happen.
But even that, Greenfield said, would be just “a stop-gap measure.”
“It’s really just a life preserver until, hopefully, the cavalry comes,” he said.
“I’m like a guy who shows up in the ER and hopes the doctors are going to do the right thing,” Greenfield said. “I’m in the ER, we’ve shown up at the ER, we’re saying we’re dying over here, we need help. It’s up to the government to helps us or leave us to die.”
The state Senate has been pushing for funding for the pantries.
The Cuomo administration said, “Budget negotiations are ongoing,” when asked for comment."

A Brooklyn woman suffered severe burns across her body when someone snuck up on her outside her home and splashed her with what appeared to be acid, cops said.
The 39-year-old woman was taking the garbage out just before 11 p.m. Sunday in front of her Borough Park home when an unidentified man doused her with the unknown liquid, cops said.
The corrosive fluid caused second-degree burns all over the woman’s upper body, face and hands, sources and police said.
The woman was transported to Maimonides Hospital, where she was in stable condition, police said.
The attacker didn’t say a word to the woman, who was of Asain descent. The NYPD was not investigating the incident as a hate crime. 
Since the coronavirus outbreak in NYC, the department has investigated 10 cases where Asian people were targeted over the pandemic. 
The random assault comes as the Big Apple sees a significant downturn in crime — with a nearly 20 percent dip in major felonies over the last 28 days, according to NYPD data. 
Felony assaults were down by about 270 over the past four weeks compared to the same time last year, the data released Monday shows. 
The serious assaults were still slightly up year to date as of Sunday by 1.5 percent — despite the major effect the pandemic COVID-19 has had on city crime."

“This is obviously not the lottery I wanted to hit, but I will press on through it,” Robert Duffy — the federal Transportation Security Administration’s director of security at LaGuardia, Islip, Westchester and upstate Stewart airports — told colleagues Friday in an e-mail obtained by The Post.
“While I am required to stay out of work for the next 14 days, I will keep on top of the ongoing activity.”
Duffy wrote that he received the results from his doctor earlier Friday.
His e-mail came three days after he reported that a TSA agent at LaGuardia had tested positive for the COVID-19 bug — at that point, the second at the Queens airport to be infected with the virus.
At least 11 TSA employees in the New York area tested positive for the deadly bug before Duffy’s announcement.
“You are doing outstanding work in this difficult and challenging time,” Duffy added to staffers in the e-mail. “You have my full confidence to keep fulfilling our obligations to the American people who place their trust and confidence in us every day.”
The federal agency last week had workers scrub clean areas of LaGuardia’s Terminal B, where the two more recently diagnosed workers were assigned.
TSA officials did not respond to a request for comment Sunday.

155,Video shows packed NYC subway cars amid coronavirus pandemic,https://nypost.com/2020/03/29/video-shows-packed-nyc-subway-cars-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/,2020-03-29 00:00:00,"A fed-up straphanger went off the rails on social media over recent packed city subway cars, trashing the MTA for its alleged shoddy service and posting videos of stuffed trains in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
“We’re all going to f–king die,” the woman says in a YouTube clip shot Friday. “Packed. And then you continue to say 6 feet away from each other. How is this possible?
“How is this possible with the MTA?” said the woman, who described herself as an essential health care worker who commutes from the Bronx to Queens. “Last week, the trains were empty. And now, this week, it’s packed. This is (a) death trap, and we have to go to work. And you have people waiting 20 minutes, a half-hour in between, because MTA workers are sick.”
“Anxiety is not the word,” she says in another video. “This is day three that is packed. We’re supposed to be 6 feet away from each other, and look at [the] MTA. … People are dying.”
The footage shows packed subway trains and platforms, in some cases shoulder to shoulder with each other. At one point, a man is heard in the background selling drugs inside the crowded car.
The MTA has been hard hit by the COVID-19 bug, with at least two workers dying from the virus and at least 156 others testing positive — while another 1,181 have self-quarantined, officials said.
“If you’re short-staffed, then you should close the MTA down and people stay at home,” the straphanger said. “This is ridiculous.
“Gov. Cuomo, how serious are you?” she said. “The MTA has to be addressed.”"

Bus and subway employees already called out sick at three times the normal rate last week, prompting the MTA to dramatically reduce service.
While the MTA’s bus-facilities department has told its entire maintenance team to come in Monday,  similar functions at other departments are at 50 percent personnel levels, per state orders, a senior source said.
“Most people think there’s just going to be a mass sickout,” the source said. “That’s what the managers are preparing for, that they’re not going to have anybody in their shop.”
Meanwhile, workers say they are reduced to cleaning their own workspaces with homemade bleach concoctions.
At least two transit workers have already died from the virus. The MTA has confirmed 157 cases, including agency Chairman Pat Foye, who tested positive Saturday morning. Hundreds more have self-quarantined due to possible COVID-19 exposure, primarily from New York City Transit.
But staffers who call in to the MTA hot line for guidance often don’t even get a chance to leave a voicemail before the line goes dark.
“Nobody has been able to get through to it,” said City Hall tower operator Malikia Burton.
The control tower that Burton works in with as many as four other people at once hasn’t been getting cleaned daily, she said. She and others have been frustrated by the lack of protective gear and cleaning supplies and the crowding in small break rooms that has resulted from running fewer trains.
The agency’s every-72-hour train-cleaning procedures are so shambolic that staffers have resorted to bringing in DIY bleach mixtures to wipe down their work spaces.
A 26-year subway veteran, who requested anonymity, told The Post he’s been cleaning his conductor’s cab with a homemade bleach brew.
“People are nervous. It’s mentally draining because you feel as though you’re by yourself,” he said. “My kids are looking at me crazy, like I’m going to come home and start glowing.”
A train operator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, sent in pictures of the dryer wipes he uses to avoid directly touching his dashboard. A type-2 diabetic, the operator said some of his frightened immuno-compromised colleagues have called out sick.
“My co-worker took off of work, went back to work earlier this week, I believe for one day, and [Thursday] morning he was diagnosed.” the motorman said.
“Eventually, there won’t be anyone to operate the trains.”
More than half of bus and subway employees are over 50, according to the city comptroller’s office, putting them at higher risk.
The MTA on Friday said it had already distributed 90,000 ounces of hand sanitizer, 190,000 wipes and disposable gloves.
It also finally agreed to distribute masks — after a call from The Post, a month of back-and-forth with labor and weeks saying they were not recommended by the CDC.
Workers will only get one single-use surgical mask per week — which one senior source described as “about as bad as putting a paper towel on your face.”
“The masks we got are like paper,” the source said. “You have to use them for a week. Moisture from your breath spreads germs.”
In an interview Sunday, MTA Chief Safety Officer Pat Warren said the agency had been holding off distributing the face coverings until the state had enough supply for medical personnel.
Warren admitted that the hot line is a work-in-progress and said the agency has hired an outside contractor to increase capacity over the next week.
“We are building this as we go,” Warren said. “In the last weeks we’ve had a tenfold increase in the amount of calls [we’re] taking.
“But it’s still not adequate,” he said of the set-up. “It’s not even close to adequate.”"

NEW YORK — Country singer Joe Diffie, who had a string of hits in the 1990s with chart-topping ballads and honky-tonk singles like “Home” and “Pickup Man,” has died after testing positive for COVID-19. He was 61.
Diffie on Friday announced he had contracted the coronavirus, becoming the first country star to go public with such a diagnosis. Diffie’s publicist Scott Adkins said the singer died Sunday in Nashville, Tennessee, due to complications from the virus.
Diffie, a native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, was a member of the Grand Ole Opry for more than 25 years. His hits included “Honky Tonk Attitude,” “Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox (If I Die),” “Bigger Than the Beatles” and “If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets).”
His mid-90s albums “Honkey Tonk Attitude” and “Third Rock From the Sun” went platinum. Eighteen of Diffie’s singles landed in the top 10, with five going No. 1. In his 2013 single “1994,” Jason Aldean name-checked the ’90s country mainstay.

That’s a jump of 300 cases since Saturday.
“We know that those numbers are going to continually grow,” Shea said of confirmed cases. “We’re looking at both sides of the spectrum, quite frankly: what is the current sick rate as officers are still becoming infected? And when is that beginning to plateau?”
The number of cops out sick Sunday was close to 5,000, or nearly 14 percent of the force, according to the commissioner. That number is up by nearly 800 officers from the day prior.
Shea did not say how long cops were being told to stay home once they go out with potentially deadly pandemic COVID-19.
The growing numbers come a day after the NYPD lost its first uniformed officer to the virus.
The 48-year-old Cedric Dixon worked in the 32nd Precinct in Harlem and died Saturday morning.
Dixon was the third member of the NYPD to die over the past few days. On Thursday, an administrative aide in the Bronx and 62-year-old cleaner at 1 Police Plaza were both claimed by COVID-19.

President Trump on Sunday announced that federal social-distancing guidelines would be extended to April 30 in an effort to curb the coronavirus outbreak.
The initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government was set to expire on Monday.
But “Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all,” Trump said during a briefing outside the White House.
The US has more than 130,000 cases of COVID-19 and at least 2,300 deaths — and the death toll is expected to peak in two weeks, Trump said.
Trump had previously aimed to reopen the country on Easter, April 12, but said Sunday that was “just an aspiration.”
The mitigation methods aim to decrease the number of infections and deaths, and the more people adhere to them, “the faster this nightmare will end,” Trump said.
“I want the American people to know that your selfless, inspiring and valiant efforts are saving countless lives. You are making the difference,” he said.
Trump’s announcement came as White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci stood by a warning he’d given earlier in the day on CNN that US deaths from the virus could be between 100,000 and 200,000.
“I think it’s entirely conceivable that if we do not mitigate to the extent that we’re trying to do, that could reach that number …  it’s possible,” he told reporters.
Also at the briefing, Department of Health and Human Services assistant secretary Adm. Dr. Brett P. Giroir announced that self-swab coronavirus tests will be rolled out next week.
“It was a very big thing that the FDA approved last week and it will now be implemented this week,” Giroir said.
With the approval, people with suspected cases of COVID-19 will be able to use a foam swab in their nose to collect a sample that they then put into a plastic bag for testing.
This would eliminate the need for health care workers to change their personal protective equipment every time they perform a test, saving much-needed resources.
“Instead of having a provider stick this all the way in the back of your nose, that’s uncomfortable but it also requires PPE changes every time it’s done,” Giroir said. “This not only increases the speed but it eliminates all those changes of PPE.”
Trump announced at the briefing that “critical” medical supplies and protective gear had arrived in New York on Sunday — but suggested that some hospitals could be stockpiling gear."

Even if New York gets all the ventilators it needs to handle the growing coronavirus crisis, there’s still one major question — who will operate them, medical experts say.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said the state needs 30,000 ventilators if hospitals get swamped with critically ill COVID-19 patients under the worst-case scenario.
Yet there are only a total of 7,713 respiratory specialists licensed to operate the breathing machines in New York, plus an unknown number of highly skilled nurses and doctors trained to use them.
“I read that Gov. Cuomo said that ventilators are to coronavirus what missiles were to World War II. While I am sure this is true, you would not have grabbed a front-line soldier off the battlefield, put him in the fighter cockpit and expect him to fly the plane, launch the missiles and defeat the enemy,’’ said Anthony Everidge, a 30-year veteran respiratory specialist who now works in Nevada but is still licensed to operate in New York.
“The outcome would be disastrous and would only compound the problem. The analogy applies to ventilators and the successful operation and management of the mechanical ventilator,” he said.
Everidge, a member of the American Association for Respiratory Care, said he worries there will “not be enough” skilled respiratory therapists, or doctors and nurses with knowledge to operate the ventilators based on the current number of licensed operators.
Ventilators help gravely ill patients breathe by pumping air and oxygen into the lungs through a tube put in the nose or mouth to reach the windpipe. The machine delivers more oxygen into the patient than any other method and also supplies pressure to keep the lungs open.
Cuomo has discussed the need to stockpile 30,000 ventilators if a crush of COVID-19 patients hits the hospital system in the next 14 to 21 days. But he has spoken less about staffing the ventilators.
The governor, during a press briefing Sunday, reported that 76,019 health care workers, including retirees, have agreed to volunteer to help New York’s strained medical facilities.
Of that total, he said 669 were respiratory therapists.
The state Health Department did not dispute that staffing issues for ventilators is a challenge.
A Health Department spokesman referred The Post to prior statements the governor has made about staffing issues.
“You can create beds, you find the equipment, you have to have the staff,” Cuomo said.
Mayor Bill de Blasio also said Sunday that he spoke to President Trump about the need for ventilators and “medical personnel.” He said city hospitals need at least 15,000 ventilators.
The respiratory specialists are like nurses for respiratory care. They monitor patients’ lung functions during their shifts by checking the data from the ventilator and adjusting the machine accordingly, Everidge said.
Compounding the problem is that COVID-19 patients who are admitted to intensive care units are sicker than the typical patient who is intubated.
The typical patient is on a ventilator for three days. But COVID-19 patients are hooked to a ventilator for anywhere from 10 days to 21 days — with a high death rate, Cuomo said.
In a sign of the dire times, the state last week approved the controversial practice of having two patients share a single ventilator.
“It’s not ideal,” Cuomo said, “but we believe it’s workable.”
The Northwell Health system employs 400 respiratory therapists at its 23 regional hospitals — including Lenox Hill, Long Island Jewish and Staten Island University hospitals.
A spokesman said there is no shortage of ventilator operators — at least for now."
162,A disaster for democracy and other commentary,https://nypost.com/2020/03/29/a-disaster-for-democracy-and-other-commentary/,2020-03-29 00:00:00,"Media watch: A Disaster for Democracy
Americans have mixed feelings about many institutions amid the virus crisis, a recent Gallup poll found, but they’re unanimous in their disdain for one institution: the media. That’s a “disaster for a liberal democracy,” sighs National Review’s David Harsanyi — and the blame lies with “the press’ own blinkered, sanctimonious and transparently partisan temperament.” That especially includes prestige outlets like The Washington Post and The New York Times. While “institutional bias” at the two ­papers “isn’t new,” both used to have “a corresponding level of professional gravitas that engendered reader trust.” No longer, as shown by the “frivolous gotchas rather than pertinent questions” they’ve flung at President Trump’s coronavirus task force briefings. Bottom line: The media’s ­“ineptitude and malfeasance” are especially “dangerous during a pandemic.”
Physician: Next Up, Herd Immunity
At Spectator USA, critical-care physician and medicine professor Matt Strauss cheers draconian “measures to suppress COVID-19 through ­enforced social distancing,” which have already suppressed the outbreak in Wuhan, China, and will likely achieve the same in the West in coming weeks and months. But in the long term, policymakers should “aim to achieve herd immunity in a controlled and strategic manner,” lest the virus return with a vengeance once lockdown measures are lifted. That would involve deploying widespread testing, as Germany and South Korea have done, plus exploiting the virus’ unique mortality profile — “people under 50 are 25 times less likely to die of COVID-19 than people over 80” — to gradually ­expose less vulnerable groups until herd immunity is achieved. Yes, social distancing was necessary, otherwise neither young nor old “would have taken the pandemic seriously.” That said, “once these measures have proved their effect, and the virus is demonstrably suppressed, public health authorities could consider ratcheting restrictions down” while remaining mindful of “demographic vulnerability” among the elderly and infirmed.
Conservative: Don’s Inconvenient Popularity
“When polls showed that President Donald Trump was receiving unusually high marks for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic,” liberals and their media allies went, first, through the denial stage, quips The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway. The left had tried to “craft a narrative” that the coronavirus spread was Trump’s fault — and just couldn’t believe the American people wouldn’t accept it. Then ideologies “began blaming [Trump’s] press conferences” — and now they’re “demanding he shut them down.” It’s shameful but unsurprising and all too telling that such calls for “censorship” have also gained the support of a spokesman for “Communist China’s Foreign Ministry.”
Libertarian: Digital to the Rescue
“A vibrant digital economy” is catering to the public’s “myriad” needs as the pandemic forces the world to retreat indoors, cheers the Taxpayers Protection Alliance’s Ross Marchand at The Washington Examiner. Thanks to e-commerce and countless tech firms, people “can be #TogetherApart and support each other.” Companies and organizations can hold meetings via Skype and Zoom. Those seeking health information can follow epidemiologists and intellectuals on social media. The “digital domain” also offers “speedy deliveries of foodstuffs and other essential items.” The vital role of these tech services shouldn’t be lost on lawmakers, like Sen. Josh Hawley, who “question their value and scheme to regulate them out of existence.” Over-regulation will only make us “less prepared in the future.”
Religion beat: A Corona ‘Great Awakening’?
In The Wall Street Journal, Robert Nicholson wonders: “Could a plague of biblical proportions be America’s best hope for religious revival?” After all, “the pandemic has remade everyday life and wrecked the global economy in a way that feels apocalyptic.” For a nation with a biblical foundation, however, “cataclysms need not mark the end. They are a call for repentance and revival. As the pandemic subjects US hospitals to a fearsome test, Americans can find solace” in the faith of their forefathers. “Great struggle can produce great clarity.”

A 108-year-old British woman who survived the 1918 Spanish Flu succumbed to the coronavirus, according to a report.
Hilda Churchill died in a Salford nursing home on Saturday, hours after testing positive for COVID-19 — and just eight days before her 109th birthday, The Guardian reported.
The oldest known coronavirus victim in the UK, Hilda was born in 1911, seven years before the influenza that infected 500 million people worldwide and killed her 12-month-old baby sister.
“It was never something she talked about being frightened of, though,” said her grandson, Anthony Churchill. But “she was scared of this new virus.”
“She survived so much and this was just another thing,” Anthony said. “She was a person who just got on with things — never asked for sympathy or said she was hard done by.”
The last time Anthony visited his grandmother they chatted about the coronavirus.
“She said it was very similar to the Spanish flu but in her day there were no planes and somehow it still managed to spread everywhere,” he said.
Hilda and most of her family became infected with the Spanish Flu while living in Crewe in Cheshire.
“She remembers everyone getting it and her mother trying to look after them and her father collapsing in a street and having to be carried home,” her grandson said.
“She was saying how amazing it is that something you can’t see can be so devastating.”
A seamstress, Hilda moved to Salford during the Great Depression to find work. She had four children, 11 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.
She had been in good health until a fall and moved into the nursing home 10 months ago.
“She had a fall and her legs just packed up. She never understood how she got so old. I think it was the hard work that kept her going. That and good genes,” Anthony said.
“She had been with me all of my life — she was just the best and we are totally heartbroken.”"

The coronavirus test administered to the Bronx Zoo tiger that tested positive for the illness is different from ones given to humans, according to the zoo’s chief veterinarian.
“The COVID-19 testing that was performed on our Malayan tiger Nadia was performed in a veterinary school laboratory and is not the same test as is used for people,” Dr. Paul Calle said in a statement tweeted Sunday night.
“You cannot send human samples to the veterinary laboratory, and you cannot send animal tests to the human laboratories, so there is no competition for testing between these very different situations.”
After the Wildlife Conservation Society revealed Nadia’s diagnosis on Sunday, many people on social media, including city politicians, expressed frustration that an animal had testing access while many humans haven’t been so fortunate.
“A tiger at the Bronx Zoo has more access to testing than the people of the South Bronx, where the risk of dying from COVID-19 is twice as high as the rest of the City,” City Councilman Ritchie Torres tweeted.
Nadia, and five other big cats that developed a dry cough, are expected to recover, the WCS said.
None of the other cats at the zoo, which includes leopards, cheetahs and pumas, have shown symptoms, the society said.
Zoo officials said they hope Nadia’s diagnosis “will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world’s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus.”
The zoo has been closed since March 16 due to the spread of the virus.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, animals can become infected by the coronavirus, but scientists don’t believe they can spread the bug to humans."
166,Rikers Island inmate dies of complications from coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/rikers-island-inmate-with-coronavirus-dies/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"An inmate at Rikers Island who tested positive for the coronavirus died on Sunday, marking the first confirmed death of a prisoner with the disease in the Big Apple, a Department of Correction spokesperson confirmed.
The 53-year-old man was transferred from the sprawling jail facility to Bellevue Hospital on March 26 and eventually died there, according to the spokesperson, Peter Thorne.
He’d been at the lock up since Feb. 28, according to The New York Times, which first reported his death.
“Our deepest condolences go out to the detainee’s family in their time of grief,” Thorne said in a statement. “The safety and well-being of those in our custody remains our number one priority.”
At least 273 inmates at city jails and 321 correction staffers had tested positive for COVID-19 as of Sunday, the department said. Four Correction employees have died from the disease.
DOC does not clarify which of its facilities were affected but the vast majority of inmates are locked up on Rikers Island.
Since the coronavirus outbreak hit Rikers in mid-March, the city has released at least 200 inmates from jail facilities.
City officials, defense attorneys and prosecutors have been working to identify prisoners who could be moved from jail to house arrest while they await trial.
The Legal Aid Society last month filed four lawsuits to get some of its clients out of Rikers and to win freedom for juvenile detainees."
167,Upper East Side mom helps feed health workers on front lines of coronavirus fight,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/nyc-restaurants-feeding-health-workers-on-front-lines-of-coronavirus/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"New York City’s restaurants may be hanging on by a thread, but they’re still feeding area health-care workers with the help of one Upper East Side mom.
Gabrielle Armour, a non-practicing lawyer with three kids, was on lockdown with the rest of the city on her 50th birthday when she decided to ask her Facebook pals to donate money to help feed hospital workers in honor of her big day.
At first, just a handful of her 600-plus friends donated. But after she posted her first thank-you note — from a nurse in a COVID-19 ICU unit at NYU Hospital — the donations started rolling in.
By April 3, just 10 days later, Armour had raised more than $4,900 on Facebook, including $400 she donated herself. Together, they have fed more than 600 people on the front lines of the Empire State’s coronavirus outbreak.
“My birthday was the second day of stay-in shelter. I couldn’t walk through Central Park. My kids weren’t in school. Our world was changing. We didn’t know what was happening, but we were OK,” Armour said. “Instead of feeling sorry for myself, I thought, we aren’t hit hard. It’s the people in the hospitals. Let’s do something to help them and not think about ourselves.”
After receiving her first round of donations, Armour scrolled through her Instagram account in search of hungry hospital workers until she discovered that someone she followed was an NYU nurse.
“We had never spoken. I didn’t even know her name, I just knew her as a gluten-free foodie. But I saw she was a nurse, so I messaged her. I said that my friends and I were sending food deliveries to hospitals for my birthday and would she be interested in receiving. She responded yes,” Armour said.
Nicole Urban — the same NYU Hospital nurse who later sent Armour a thank-you note — requested Chipotle for herself and roughly two dozen of her co-workers, followed by a similarly sized order from Zucker’s Bagels.
“Feeding them gave my 50th birthday some purpose at a time we felt so helpless,” Armour said.
Since then, she has donated pizzas to Sloan Kettering and Mount Sinai East; Lena’s Italian Kitchen and Zucker’s Bagels to NYU; Pappardelle to Mount Sinai West and Kesté Pizza to NY’s Columbia Presbyterian. She still finds health-care workers to feed through social media, but has also started taking requests from friends and family who know someone on the front line.
Rachael Blaire, a physician’s assistant at Mount Sinai West, says she was in the midst of a gruelling 24-hour shift when Armour sent her and her co-workers food from Pappardella, an Italian eatery on the Upper West Side, on Thursday night.
“I was blown away,” Blaire said. “At least 30 people enjoyed the dinner — and it was so good. Everyone was raving about it and very grateful and appreciative. I hope people see that the restaurants are also struggling and that giving donations also helps them.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said there is no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted through food.
But sit-down dining has been banned in several states, including New York, to reduce the risk of exposure through people, plates and utensils.
Despite the restaurant industry’s woes, some eatery owners have been going out of their way to help, Armour said. When she first ordered from Kesté Pizza, for example, she only had $280 — enough to order around 15 pizzas. So Roberto Caporuscio, Kesté’s owner and pizzaiolo, added 85 pizzas free of charge for a total of 100 pizzas.
“I was so moved, I had tears rolling down my face,” Armour said.
For Caporuscio, the decision was simple. “For me, it is very important to give to the hospitals. They are the heroes. I’m Italian,” Caporuscio said, adding that his fellow Italians in the food industry have also been donating their time and goods, from flowers to cheese and tomatoes.
“We just want to help,” Caporuscio said. “If we can help people risking their lives at the hospitals, I am able to sleep better at night.”
Caporuscio has let go of around 15 people since the pandemic hit, but has been able to keep on 35 employees — and most, he says, are still working full-time.
“Delivering food is something I can do,” he said. “We do our own delivery, wearing masks and gloves. We are very careful. I drive the car. The nurses come outside to pick up the food. I can’t complain. At least I have work for my employees.”"

The New York City restaurant industry faces an existential threat worse than from any previous catastrophe. Eateries will survive the coronavirus nightmare — but salvation will more likely come out of good-faith bargaining between desperate owners and beleaguered landlords than from various government-relief proposals now being urged by restaurant-business advocates.
The crisis is acute. Some 25,000 sit-down dining venues stand dark. Apart from the heartbreaking suspension of the Big Apple’s essential noshing and socializing scene, upward of 320,000 local jobs are gone. Owners lost more than $2 billion in revenue in four weeks.
Takeout and delivery have failed to help much. Operators are scrambling to sell off t-shirts and expensive vintage wine in a desperate bid to stay afloat. There’s no way to know when they’ll be able to reopen or how many — even including the Big Apple’s most iconic names — will survive.
Esteemed chefs and owners including Tom Colicchio, Daniel Boulud and Danny Meyer, as well as the New York Hospitality Alliance, correctly argue that the $2 trillion federal stimulus bill included only crumbs for restaurants. Its “payroll protection plan” offers loans that are convertible to grants — but that may be untenable for owners, who’d have to keep employees on the books without knowing when they’ll reopen.
Advocates want relief in various forms, such as mandating insurance coverage for policies that don’t include pandemics and several plausible cash-infusion strategies.
They’re well-meant and important, but the more enduring solution will likely involve the real-estate free market — even though, at the moment, the very idea of a “free market’’ is in limbo.
Lease payments are a restaurant’s most daunting fixed cost (usually around 10 percent of the total). Although often less than for operating costs such as labor, food and supplies, it’s the toughest nut to crack because it’s impossible to change. A shuttered eatery can lay off its whole staff and spend nothing on food but is still on the hook for monthly rent.
How can owners such as Havana Central’s Jeremy Merrin, who pays $1 million a year for his Times Square location, afford that while having zero revenue?
He can’t. But then, the sort-of good news is that isn’t a matter of charity for landlords to restructure restaurant-tenant leases. They have to pay mortgages, insurance and taxes. So they simply can’t afford to evict a restaurant tenant even after Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s three-month moratorium on evictions is over.
This is as true for the family owners of a three-story tenement in Greenpoint as it is for a publicly traded real-estate giant in Midtown Manhattan.
Why? Because, simply, who would replace the restaurant when the entire US economy is frozen in place? A shoe store? They’re closed, too. It’s true that landlords have lots of debt, but count on their lenders, too, to come to accommodations even if not contractually obligated to.
Short-term fixes might help restaurants in the very short term, yet rent amelioration will matter much more when they’re able to reopen. Whether current or future restaurants can afford to occupy their spaces will determine their futures.
But any legal mandates to forgive current rents require fast action by the state Legislature and the governor, and they have larger matters on their plates.
The hopeful news is that chaotic but likely productive dialogues between restaurateurs and landlords are under way. The right path requires cooperation, not confrontation. Eatery owners and property owners are in it together and need to work in everyone’s mutual best interest.
Progress is being made. As reported by Eater.com, the Boqueria Spanish tapas chain has already secured temporary rent waivers at many of its locations, thanks to constructive talks with landlords.
And more landlords will follow suit, or at least make some concessions. It’s better for the property owner than having more dark storefronts — for which there’s no tax break despite widespread misconceptions.
Landlords and office tenants cooperated magnificently after 9/11. The same thing can happen again for restaurants — but only if all parties take the long-term view. Otherwise, the eateries will give up for good and leave their landlords in worse shape than they are."
169,Time to start figuring out which businesses can reopen first and how,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/its-time-to-figure-out-which-businesses-can-reopen-first-and-how/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
How do we reopen after the coronavirus goes away? The mere question, in the middle of the pandemic, is fraught.
Anyone entertaining the idea that businesses should move toward reopening is shamed as caring more about the stock market than people dying. Any discussion of how to get people working again is met with people smugly screaming “stay home!” at each other.
I am staying home, along with my whole family. We’re collectively taking COVID-19 very seriously. We’ve been in self-quarantine since March 13 — before restaurants and bars in the city were shut down, before Mayor Bill de Blasio finally closed city schools and days before his last trip to the gym.
All that to note that I’m no COVID-truther who thinks this is no big deal — it’s a very big deal. But looking ahead, figuring out a way to get people back to work has to be permitted. In fact, it’s essential.
It’s hard not to notice that many of the people shrieking and shaming are still employed. What about all the people who don’t have any money coming in for their families? We need to figure out the path back for them.
Businesses can’t open tomorrow or next week. But how do we get our city working again?
Must it be all or nothing? Can some businesses take proper precautions and reopen sooner than others?
De Blasio has to stop taking to cable news shows to be a foil for President Trump and actually get to work on this. Reopening New York can’t be done with blanket policies. We won’t one day flip a switch and have our businesses open again.
Rather, we’ll have to take businesses on a case-by-case basis. We’ll need a mechanism for them to explain how they’ll take proper precautions and then petition to open.
There is currently no way for a business to argue that it should be allowed to function. For example, in Gov. Cuomo’s directive to end non-essential construction, an exception is made for work done by “a single worker, who is the sole employee/worker on a job site.”
What about a job that requires two workers who can stay six feet apart? There has to be a place to appeal for an exception.
Another example: Gyms. Some may be able to reopen ahead of others. A franchise owner at Orange­theory Fitness told me the company “invested in electrostatic cleaning sprays to disinfect between classes” and that its equipment is three feet apart, so clients could use every other station to maintain the required six-foot distance.
Could all gyms do that? Probably not. But why must they all remain shut if some can function safely?
A lot of owners of non-essential-businesses point to so-called essential businesses like liquor stores and movers and wonder why they are exempted. Grocery stores are necessary, but one owner points out that while shops may limit the number of customers entering, “once in the store, social-distancing rules start to break down.”
City Councilman Mark Gjonaj (D-Bx), who chairs the Committee on Small Business, told me of his constituents’ pain. “We often separate the employer from employee,” Gjonaj said. “I have received so many calls from employers crying and saying they can’t sleep at night because they have to let employees go. That bond is a family unit in a small business. They spend more time together than they do with their families. There’s a lot of pain and agony.
“Every government agency and department should be doing their part to think about how to save the small businesses that were the American dream,” he added. “People went into their fields as the employee and became the employer. We need support for them.”
Indeed. People are hurting, and they need hope. More than that, they need to see elected officials coming up with ideas to get them back to work. Those of us lucky enough to still be working need to speak up for those who are not. We need a plan to move forward to better days, and we need it now.

Fire departments from around The Bronx came together on Sunday to thank medical workers battling the coronavirus outbreak.
Rigs from several firehouses sounded their sirens outside Jacobi Medical Center in honor of the clinicians there — and some firefighters gave out candy and other treats to show their appreciation.
“It means the world to us to be appreciated in this way by our brothers and sisters at FDNY. We are proud and delighted,” said Jacobi’s associate executive director Barbara Delorio.
Footage of the heartwarming moment posted on Facebook by Delorio showed healthcare workers in protective face masks taking videos and photos of the tribute from a distance.
Firefighters were also spotted clapping for the medical workers and handing out baggies filled with treats.
An FDNY spokesman said members have made it a point to show their support and acknowledge hospital staff as they continue to battle the pandemic.
New York’s Bravest have held similar events at hospitals in or near their response areas around the city, the spokesman said.
Like other hospitals around the city, Jacobi has been hit with a shortage of protective personal equipment amid the outbreak, with nurses there on Saturday protesting a scarcity of masks and gloves."

North Korea is telling the world it doesn’t have a single, solitary case of coronavirus. It’d be hilarious if the lie didn’t stand for untold human suffering.
“Not one single person has been infected with the novel coronavirus in our country so far,” Pak Myong Su, a senior health official in North Korea, told AFP.
Right. North Korea’s only major trading partner is next-door China, where the epidemic started and which let the virus spread for weeks without raising any alarms. And its other neighbor, South Korea, has more than 10,000 confirmed cases.
Said Gen. Robert Abrams, commander of US forces in South Korea, “I can tell you that is an impossible claim based on all of the intel we have seen.”
Fine, the bizarro regime in Pyongyang eventually closed its borders and set up inspections and other precautions — but for all that it loves to pretend to supercompetence, the only thing it actually excels at is telling bald-faced lies.
North Korea never even ’fesses up about its periodic famines — even when it’s accepting massive emergency food aid. And it has reportedly asked for help fighting the virus now: Back in February, Russia said it sent 1,500 coronavirus diagnostic kits, at North Korea’s request, “due to the persisting risk of the new COVID-19.” Doctors Without Borders and UNICEF have both sent other supplies.
Most likely, the bug is spreading almost unchecked in a nation where routine malnutrition has left much of the populace immune-challenged and a beyond-rickety health care system is collapsing.
Someday, when the people of North Korea are finally freed of the monsters who rule them, maybe the world will be able to distinguish the coronavirus mass graves from all the other evidence of routine atrocities."

The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule rolls back an Obama-era regulation that made US Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards some of the strictest in the world, beating even carbon-obsessed Europe. The change means that automakers’ fleets will have to average around 40 miles per gallon by 2025, not the 54 mpg set by the last administration in 2012.
That rule pretended that automakers could raise CAFE by 5 percent a year, every year, for decades. Now they’ll have to boost efficiency by about 1.5 percent annually, which is actually achievable.
Most Americans simply aren’t interested in tiny, difficult-to-maintain electric vehicles. (In much of the country, they simply don’t make sense since there’s nowhere to charge them.) The CAFE standards in place now raise the price of a car by an average of $3,800 — pricing some people out of the new-car market, so they keep on driving older, dirtier vehicles.
The administration estimates the new rule will lower the price of a new vehicle by about $1,000 — and cut costs for struggling American automakers by as much as $100 billion by the time 2030 models are rolled out.
As it stands, the average American’s car right now is 12 years old. The new rule could boost sales by 2.7 million over the next decade — retiring that many extra “clunkers” and so yielding a bigger reduction in actual carbon emissions. The green lobby is howling because it’s no longer in the driver’s seat — not because of any real harm.
With the US economy facing its starkest challenge in a century, measures like this are a must: Americans can’t afford symbolic environmental gestures when they’re worried about putting food on the table."

The nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is also a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has tested negative for the illness, he said Sunday.
Fauci was responding to a reporter’s question about why he was not wearing a face mask during the White House’s daily press briefing when he shared the test results.
“The major reason to wear a face mask, is to protect you from infecting you,” Fauci said while pointing into the press gallery.
“I had my test yesterday and it’s negative,” he said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued new guidance recommending Americans voluntarily wear face coverings to help curb the spread of coronavirus.
The Trump administration, CDC and public health officials have all wavered on the issue of face masks since the pandemic broke out, initially telling healthy people such measures were unnecessary or even counter-productive."

In modeling COVID-19’s trajectory, “there’s no right answer,” warns Zeynep Tufekci at The Atlantic — but that’s “not what epidemiological models are for.” People “get mad” because “models aren’t crystal balls.” Yet models can help you “calibrate” actions to avoid “catastrophic” outcomes. When scientist Neil Ferguson projected the UK would see 500,000 deaths from COVID-19 absent drastic intervention, the country ordered folks to stay home. A few days later, he projected only 20,000 deaths. That wasn’t “walking back” his initial projection; his original paper had laid out “a range of predictions — from tens of thousands to 500,000 dead” — because the possible outcomes were “highly sensitive to our actions.” Rather than get “bogged down” in a model’s numbers, advises Tufekci, better to focus on “parameters we can change.” And then “change them.”
Conservative: How To Deal With Inmates
In response to the pandemic, the far left wants government to free “most every prisoner and detainee” — but, Tim Young points out at The Washington Times, that sidesteps the obvious question: “Where would these people go?” Most of them would have no jobs and no money “to provide for their own basic needs,” potentially forcing them to “revert to crime” to survive. Better to release just those who committed “minor, non-violent” crimes and have “served a majority of their sentence.” We should also use “alternate ways to improve the conditions in prisons and detention facilities,” including switching to privately run facilities. Solving this problem, contends Young, involves “compromise — and the private sector.”
Foreign desk: What Did Xi Know — and When?
Bradley A. Thayer and Lianchao Han at The Hill are furious at the Chinese Communist Party for triggering the “global public-health crisis.” Beijing’s conduct has been “reprehensible,” they fume. It “suppressed whistleblowers and information, destroyed lab samples” and blocked international experts who might have blunted the outbreak. Thayer and Han demand to know: “What did China’s [President] Xi Jinping know — and when did he know it?” The ­regime first learned in December that the virus was “transmitted human to human.” Between late December and early January, “five firms and institutions detected a SARS-like” disease affecting people in ­Wuhan. But by the time Xi ordered a lockdown in late January, 5 million people had left the city, igniting “the global spread of the virus.”
From the right: Time To Make Beijing Pay
If the fight against the coronavirus is “war,” then “let’s treat it like one,” Theodore Roosevelt Malloch and Pythagoras Petrato snap at American Greatness. The enemy: Communist China. Besides its “unfathomable” role in spreading the virus, it’s sought to “dominate the Asian theatre, steal foreign intellectual property, control global supply lines and important future technologies, and generally, through its state-owned enterprises and government-backed trade policies, seize the global economy.” Beijing “must pay”: The world must hold Chinese leaders accountable for “harm and damages,” cut “all critical supply chains,” including “pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and instruments” and freeze the accounts of Chinese officials” who prolonged the pandemic. The Chinese have to “pay the price for their malignant behavior.”
Libertarian: Progressive Censors’ Comeuppance
Democratic and progressive activists are learning that censorship works “in mysterious ways” — and that they won’t always get to be the censor, chuckles Reason’s Nick Gillespie. In arguing that President Trump’s “inaction” made the pandemic worse, “Trump’s political opponents understandably want to flood the Internet with messages about just how bad the ‘cheeto in chief’ really is, but they’re running into the very restrictions they were applauding last fall,” when Twitter said it would stop taking political ads and “Google, the 800-lb. gorilla of online advertising, announced plans” to limit them. Google has now rejected ads criticizing the Trump administration’s response to the crisis. “The answer to bad, misleading, stupid, hateful speech is more and better speech,” Gillespie writes — not ceding “control to gatekeepers who may not be any smarter or disinterested than we are.”

175,Woody Harrelson among stars sharing coronavirus conspiracy theories tied to 5G,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/woody-harrelson-sharing-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-tied-to-5g/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Wild conspiracy theories linking 5G networks to the coronavirus pandemic are being blamed for a spate of attacks on UK cellphone towers — and are even being spread by celebrities such as Woody Harrelson.
Fires at towers in Birmingham, Liverpool and Belfast have all been blamed on the conspiracy theories, UK officials said. The theories have ranged from 5G signals causing the virus, to the contagion being started as a cover-up for health maladies related to the networks.
UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove damned the tales as “dangerous nonsense” while noting that the damaged phone lines are crucial for emergency services battling the pandemic.
Yet the conspiracy theories are quickly reaching a massive audience — thanks in parts to celebrities now sharing them with millions of people on social media.
Former “Cheers” TV star Woody Harrelson recently posted a report “about the negative effects of 5G” and its supposed role in the coronavirus pandemic to his more than 2 million Instagram followers.
“I haven’t fully vetted it I find it very interesting,” he wrote of the report claiming that “5G radiation” is “exacerbating” the contagion’s spread and making it more lethal.
That post got 25,500 likes — while a later one of a video showing Chinese campaigners attacking phone towers there got viewed more than 300,000 times.
Singer M.I.A. has also repeatedly tweeted about her fears over 5G — recently saying that even if it does not cause COVID-19, it “can confuse or slow the body down in healing process as body is learning to cope with new signals wavelength s frequency etc @ same time as Cov.”
The “Paper Planes” rapper even posted a photo of one of the burning towers.
“People in England are setting fire to it. They should just turn it off till after the pandemic!” she wrote.
Professor Stephen Powis, the UK’s national medical director, called the theories “outrageous” and “absolute and utter rubbish.”
Dr. Michael Head of the University of Southampton also told the Evening Standard that such “ignorance” could prove dangerous.
“Conspiracy theorists are a public health danger who once read a Facebook page,” he told the Evening Standard.
“The celebrities fanning the flames of these conspiracy theorists should be ashamed.”

President Trump said Sunday that the Navy hospital ship docked off Manhattan could be used to treat coronavirus patients “if we need it.”
The 1,000 bed USNS Comfort, which was intended to treat hospital overflow patients not infected with the virus, had been largely under-utilized — with just 20 patients there last Thursday.
“That was not supposed to be about the virus at all, under any circumstances,” Trump said about the ship during a daily White House coronavirus task force press briefing.
“But it looks like, more and more, we’re going to be using it for that,” he said.
The president added that “if we need it for the virus, we will be using it for that.”
Last Friday, several coronavirus patients were mistakenly transferred to the vessel from the Javits Center, which has been converted to a 3,000-bed field hospital that does permit coronavirus patients, Fox News reported.
Trump also announced a Monday shipment of 600,000 N95 masks to New York City’s public hospital system."

Hasidic Jews flouted social distancing rules and held at least two packed funerals on the streets of Brooklyn on Sunday, including one for a faith leader who died of coronavirus — as NYPD officers feebly tried to disperse the crowds by blasting warnings from their squad cars.
Video posted on Facebook shows cops driving up to dozens of mourners, sirens blaring, during a procession near 55th Street and 12th Avenue in Borough Park that was held for 78-year-old Rabbi Meir Rokeach, who reportedly died of COVID-19 on Saturday night.
“This is not six feet,” an officer in a protective face mask says over the loudspeaker, as members of the Orthodox Jewish community continue to congregate.
The officers then play a recording reminding those gathered to maintain at least a 6-foot distance while in public as a way to stem the spread of the virus.
But the masses of mourners ignored the warnings, though one man was seen approaching the patrol car to apologize.
Hours later, throngs of Hasidic Jews, some in blue face masks, attended another outdoor funeral procession about a mile away near 44th Street and 16th Avenue. Police also responded and asked the congregation to disperse.
At both of the gatherings, the funeral attendees asked for more time to grieve, and cops, “wanting to be respectful because they were in mourning,” gave them about five minutes before starting to play the recording heard in the video, an NYPD spokeswoman said.
The crowds eventually tapered off, she said. There were no arrests or citations issued in either incident.
The events were held just days after another Hasidic Jewish funeral on Avenue N near East 9th Street in Midwood.
Last month, members of New York City’s Hasidic and Orthodox Jewish community openly violated social distancing orders by hosting raucous Brooklyn weddings with hundreds of guests amid the growing spread of the bug.
But since then, community leaders have maintained that social distancing orders are largely being followed with every major synagogue closed, even as Passover approaches this week.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has barred crowds of 50 or more and President Trump has said Americans should avoid events with more than 10 people amid the outbreak, which has infected 64,955 and killed 2,472 in the Big Apple alone as of Sunday evening."
178,Thousands of NY COVID patients are being treated with anti-malarial drug,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/ny-coronavirus-patients-being-treated-with-anti-malarial-drug/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
As many as 4,000 seriously ill coronavirus patients in New York are being treated with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, state health officials say.
President Trump has touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential life-saver, although there is no widespread scientific evidence to date showing it helps battle COVID-19.
But Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month said health care providers in the state would be using the drug in combination with the antibiotic Zithromax, or azithromycin, for some last-ditch cases, based on potentially promising research.
“Time is of the essence,’’ Albany University Public Health Dean David Holtgrave, who is on the state’s research team, said in a statement.
A state Health Department official said the DOH has shipped doses of hydroxychloroquine to 56 hospitals across New York, distributing enough “to treat 4,000 patients to date.”
Patients have received doses as part of four- or 10-day regimens, officials said.
The University of Albany’s School of Public Health is observing the drug’s impact on the patients, and its preliminary study could come back in weeks instead of the usual months, officials said.
There are also clinical trials being conducted to see whether the drug can help block transmission.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a random trial with a $9.5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
“Currently, there is no proven way to prevent COVID-19 after being exposed,” said Anna Bershteyn, an assistant professor with the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone and the study’s co-principal investigator.
“If hydroxychloroquine provides protection, then it could be an essential tool for fighting this pandemic. If it doesn’t, then people should avoid unnecessary risks from taking the drug.”
The drug has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
Its potential side effects include everything from fatal heart arrhythmia to vision loss, ear-ringing, vomiting, mood changes, skin rashes and hair loss.
Health officials are treading cautiously, saying they don’t anticipate hydroxychloroquine will be a “miracle drug” against the coronavirus — but the studies are worth the gamble.
In terms of the NYU clinical trial regarding prevention, researchers are enrolling 2,000 adult volunteers at six sites.
They are recruiting people who lack any COVID-19 symptoms but have been in close contact with others who have a confirmed or pending diagnosis.
On a random basis, the trial participants will receive either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo pill — vitamin C — every day for two weeks.
Each day during the 14-day period and then again on Day 28, the participants will swab their nasal passages and send the samples to researchers to detect potential COVID-19 infection.
“If everything goes as planned, the eight-week trial could provide answers by summer on whether a preventive dose of the drug is safe and effective,’’ NYU Langone said in a release.
“If so, the strategy could give health officials a much needed boost in slowing person-to-person transmission.”
The federal Food and Drug Administration granted emergency-use authorization to use hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients amid the pandemic.
There has been anecdotal evidence — including from China — that the drug helps patients clear the virus sooner.
But Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, asked recently whether the drug was considered a treatment for the novel coronavirus, said, “The answer is no … The evidence that you’re talking about … is anecdotal evidence.”
Meanwhile, Northwell Health facilities — including Lenox Hill, Long Island Jewish and Staten Island University hospitals — and Maimonides Medical Center are giving moderately to seriously ill coronavirus patients certain antiviral drugs such as Sarilumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, and Remdesivir, a drug that incorporates itself into the genome.
Northwell has recruited 143 patients for a Sarilumab trial.
Mount Sinai’s-Icahn School of Medicine also is one of 34 institutions nationwide participating in the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project. The program seeks blood-plasma donations from recovered coronavirus patients that contain antibodies that can be used to fight the virus in seriously ill patients."

180,Trump administration weighs legal action over alleged Chinese hoarding of PPE,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/trump-admin-weighs-legal-action-over-alleged-chinese-hoarding-of-ppe/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Leading US manufacturers of medical safety gear told the White House that China prohibited them from exporting their products from the country as the coronavirus pandemic mounted — even as Beijing was trying to “corner the world market” in personal protective equipment, The Post has learned.
Now, the Trump administration is weighing legal action against China over its alleged actions, a lawyer for President Trump said Sunday.
“In criminal law, compare this to the levels that we have for murder,” said Jenna Ellis, a senior legal adviser to Trump’s re-election campaign.
“People are dying. When you have intentional, cold-blooded, premeditated action like you have with China, this would be considered first-degree murder.”
Ellis said the options under consideration include filing a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights or working “through the United Nations.”
Executives from 3M and Honeywell told US officials that the Chinese government in January began blocking exports of N95 respirators, booties, gloves and other supplies produced by their factories in China, according to a senior White House official.
China paid the manufacturers their standard wholesale rates, but prohibited the vital items from being sold to anyone else, the official said.
Around the same time that China cracked down on PPE exports, official data posted online shows that it imported 2.46 billion pieces of “epidemic prevention and control materials” between Jan. 24 and Feb. 29, the White House official said.
The gear, valued at nearly $1.2 billion, included more than 2 billion masks and more than 25 million “protective clothing” items that came from countries in the European Union, as well as Australia, Brazil and Cambodia, the official said.
“Data from China’s own customs agency points to an attempt to corner the world market in PPE like gloves, goggles, and masks through massive increased purchases — even as China, the world’s largest PPE manufacturer, was restricting exports,” the official said.
Last week, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to order St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M to prioritize production of N95 respirators for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Michael Wessell, a founding member of the federal US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, confirmed the situation and said the Chinese maneuvering had left American hospitals “starved of PPE to fight this crisis.”
“We understand that China has engaged in policies to try and not only develop its own capabilities, but to do so at expense of producers around the world,” said Wessell, formerly a top staffer to ex-US Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Missouri).
“At a time when demand was rising to deal with the crisis, China was marshaling all of the products for its own use.”
Wessell said that “some of China’s actions are probably illegal, but to bring cases when you’re in the middle of the crisis does little good for the patients who are in the hospital on ventilators — and might not have been there had they had access to PPE.”
Wessell also said that while China had recently begun easing exports of PPE, “they’re using it for soft power, essentially saying it’s a humanitarian gesture to try to curry goodwill with American people when some of the problems we’re facing are the direct result of Chinese policies.”
Christian Whiton, a former senior diplomacy and trade adviser to the George W. Bush and Trump administrations, described Chinese control of PPE as “political warfare.”
“It looks like a coordinated effort between the Chinese government and industry where they used to be nothing but exporters of this stuff but now they turned around and they’re importing it while banning all exports,” said Whiton, now a senior fellow for strategy and trade at the Center for National Interest.
“What is most interesting to me, when we get through this crisis I think there’s rage, not just concern, but rage in Congress about China and from the American people that China is culpable one way or the other,” he added.
Honeywell said in a statement: “For the majority of the first quarter, China was experiencing the most acute effects of the COVID-19 crisis, so all of the masks from the facility in question were utilized for local consumption. Production at the facility in question remained under Honeywell management’s control throughout the coronavirus outbreak.”
3M did not respond to requests for comment Sunday, but in a statement issued last week, noted that it had just “secured approval from China to export to the U.S. 10 million N95 respirators manufactured by 3M in China.”
Steven Bannon, a former White House chief strategist under Trump and the host of the podcast “War Room: Pandemic,” said the behavior of the Chinese government was equivalent to a “biological Chernobyl.”
“The same people that understood this virus had human-to-human transmission and was going to be a pandemic were at the same time vacuuming up every piece of PPE from the US, Brazil and Europe,” said Bannon, who formerly lived in Shanghai when he ran on an online gaming company.
“They’re at war with the West. This story shows the world what Chinese citizens are dealing with,” he said.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, didn’t respond to a request for comment."
181,Lesson of Maurice Stokes-Jack Twyman bond resonates in these coronavirus times,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/lesson-of-ex-nba-teammates-bond-resonates-in-coronavirus-times/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"The celebration was going to culminate in the 700-seat auditorium at the John F. Kennedy Student Center, tucked into the northern segment of the campus of St. Francis University in Loretto, Pa. There, Monday night, the 2,100-student school would celebrate the life of Maurice Stokes, the school’s most famous alumnus, on the 50th anniversary of his death.
“But God has his own plan,” says Rev. Malachi Van Tassell, the university’s president.
So much about the extraordinary life of Maurice Stokes must be explained, if it is to be explained at all, by those six simple words. He was a brilliant college player at St. Francis, the first player to win the MVP at the NIT from a team that didn’t win the tournament (in 1955), culminating a year in which he averaged 27.1 points and 26.2 rebounds.
He was the NBA’s rookie of the year in 1956 for the Rochester Royals, became an All-Star when that franchise moved to Cincinnati, averaged 16.4 points and 17.3 rebounds and was well on his way, at age 24, to becoming one of the greatest players in the league’s history.
But on March 12, 1958, Stokes fell and banged his head in the Royals’ regular-season finale. A few days later, on a small plane ride home from Detroit for a playoff game, he took ill. By the time he reached the hospital he was fully paralyzed, diagnosed with post-traumatic encephalopathy.
He would regain some motor skills over the years through intense physical therapy but suffered a heart attack and died on April 6, 1970, two months shy of his 37th birthday. His funeral was held at St. Francis and he is buried on campus, in the Franciscan Friar Cemetery, one of only a few lay people given their eternal rest there.
It is one of the heartbreaking stories in the history of American sports, but also one of the most redeeming, too, thanks to Stokes’ friendship with Jack Twyman. Twyman was a fellow all-star on the Royals and though the two men weren’t especially close, Stokes’ accident changed that. Twyman lived year-round in Cincinnati. Stokes’ family was in Pittsburgh. Soon after Stokes’ diagnosis, Twyman agreed to become Stokes’ legal guardian.
What followed was one of the extraordinary friendships ever formed.
One day, Jack was asked why he’d decided to make such a remarkable commitment to Maurice, and again he shrugged his shoulders and said, “Maurice needed someone. I became that someone.”
That phrase — “Become That Someone” — all these years later, has become St. Francis’ motto. And though St. Francis had to postpone its celebration of Stokes’ life, it is a message that has never seemed more relevant than it does in these turbulent, uncertain days.
“During this pandemic it’s a call for each person to become their best self,” Father Van Tassell says. “We can become that someone in any number of scenarios.”
Tim Frank was hoping to be a part of the celebration. Frank is the NBA’s senior vice president for basketball communications and he is from Altoona, Pa., less than a half-hour from St. Francis. He grew up believing Stokes was larger than life, watched Red Flash basketball games in the fieldhouse named for Stokes, looked at his retired No. 26 in the rafters there.
One of the saddest elements of Stokes’ story is that he played in the league so briefly, and even among many basketball fans his is a name that often draws blank stares. The NBA did its part to rectify that eight years ago when it created the Twyman-Stokes Award to recognize the league’s teammate of the year.
It is a poignant trophy — one figurine helping another to its feet — and the winners, who have included Chauncey Billups, Tim Duncan and Vince Carter, are invariably honored at first and then completely humbled once they read up on the award’s namesakes.
“It’s so gratifying to see that,” Frank says. “More people should know about Maurice, and more people should know about the amazing friendship he had with Jack. Especially now. This is a story that resonates.”
It does. It should. We lean on friends now as much as we ever have, more even, as much as Maurice and Jack leaned on each other. Once, late in his life, Maurice’s intense rehab yielded a small victory: he was able to regain a little flexibility in his fingers. It took him a few hours, but he finally completed his first sentence on a typewriter. He showed it to his friend:
“Dear Jack, how can I ever thank you?”
To which Jack immediately, and quintessentially, replied: “You may think I come here to cheer you up. But, really, it’s the other way around.”"

MILAN – Italy reported its lowest daily COVID-19 death toll for more than two weeks on Sunday as authorities began to look ahead to a second phase of the battle against the new coronavirus once the lockdown imposed almost a month ago is eventually eased.
The toll from the world’s deadliest outbreak reached 15,887, almost a quarter of the global death total, but the rise of 525 from a day earlier was the smallest daily increase since March 19, while the number of patients in badly stretched intensive care units fell for a second day running.
“The curve has reached a plateau and begun to descend,” said Silvio Brusaferro, head of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Italy’s top health institute. “It is a result that we have to achieve day after day.”
“If this is confirmed, we need to start thinking about the second phase and keep down the spread of this disease.”
The total number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus rose by 4,316 to 128,948, the lowest increase in five days, which added to signs the epidemic has reached a plateau, about six weeks after it broke out in northern Italy on Feb. 21.
Sunday’s figures added to growing signs the tough restrictions on movement and public gatherings imposed across the country on March 9 were having an effect in containing the epidemic, but officials have been desperate to avoid a letup.
“Don’t lower our guard, stay at home,” Angelo Borelli, head of the Civil Protection department, told a daily briefing.
But alongside the public health crisis, the government is also grappling with the economic devastation caused by the sudden halt to business across the country.
Following several days of encouraging data, Health Minister Roberto Speranza outlined a series of measures, including more testing and a beefed-up local health system, intended to allow a gradual easing until a vaccine might be developed.
“There are difficult months ahead. Our task is to create the conditions to live with the virus,” at least until a vaccine is developed, he told the daily La Repubblica newspaper.
The national lockdown, strictly limiting people’s movements and freezing all non-essential economic activity, will officially last until at least April 13 but it is widely expected to be extended. Speranza said it was too early to say when it could be lifted.
The minister said he had issued a note outlining five principles around which the government planned to manage the so-called “phase two” of the emergency, when lockdown restrictions began to be eased but before a full return to normal conditions.
He said social distancing would have to remain, with wider use of individual protection devices such as face masks, while local health systems would be strengthened, to allow a faster and more efficient treatment of suspected COVID-19 cases.
Testing and “contact tracing” would be extended, including with the use of smartphone apps and other forms of digital technology while a network of hospitals dedicated solely to treating COVID-19 patients would be set up."

A doctor at a Brooklyn hospital where body bags were seen lining the hallway described “catastrophic” conditions at the facility, saying he’s seeing coronavirus patients die daily and is terrified of infecting his family.
The pandemic hit home even harder for Dr. Tarik Naser, an attending physician at Wyckoff Medical Center, last week when his own brother, also a doctor, was hospitalized with the deadly illness.
“I might not survive, also. Who knows what will happen?,” Naser told The Post in a phone call Sunday.
Since the outbreak, Naser said the entire Bushwick hospital has been turned into a medicine department and is dedicated to treating COVID-19 patients and “nothing else.”
“Even the non-medicine doctors, like the doctors from the psychiatric department and doctors from the other departments, are helping us. This is the situation,” he said, adding that he is not speaking for the hospital.
“We are trying hard [but] we don’t have enough doctors. We don’t have enough PPE.”
Shocking photos from inside the hospital taken Saturday showed blue body bags crowding the hallways. Dozens of body bags were seen in another image piled on top of one other in a makeshift morgue.
Naser, 49, said he hadn’t personally seen the body bags but told The Post that “patients are dying every day, every moment.”
His patient load has more than doubled. On Sunday, he was overseeing 55 cases and had already lost one person to the illness.
“We’re overrun with patients,” he said. “This is a disaster.”
His brother, a doctor for the New York City Department of Health, fell ill last Sunday and tested positive for the bug. He’s now on a ventilator at Jacobi Medical Center in The Bronx.
“My own brother is … dying,” Naser said. “This is not normal.”
Naser said he fears bringing the disease home to his family — so he lives in the basement and they reside upstairs. Most of his coworkers are doing the same, he said.
Despite the dire conditions, Naser said he and his colleagues “don’t have any choice” but to keep going.
“Just pray that it should go faster, so that we can at least come back to normal life,” he implored."
184,City teacher whose family fought for potential lifesaving therapy dies from coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/city-teacher-whose-family-fought-for-potential-lifesaving-therapy-dies-from-coronavirus/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"City schoolteacher David Behrbom, whose family was battling red tape to get him pioneering therapy in his battle against COVID-19, died Sunday — just hours before a potential key breakthrough, his kin said.
Behrbom, a 47-year-old teacher at PS 55 in the Bronx, was expected to finally get donated plasma late Sunday for last-ditch convalescent plasma therapy, after The Post helped highlight his family’s desperate battle with bureaucracy over the move.
But Behrbom died in his medically induced coma in the ICU at White Plains Hospital Center at 5:50 a.m. Sunday, his heartbroken brother, Adam Cohen, told The Post.
The family had already been warned hours earlier that Behrbom might not survive the night “after he crashed two times in 15 minutes” with multiple major organ failure, Cohen said by phone.
“The doctor told me, ‘This is a hard one. Your brother really fought,'” Cohen said, saying the doctor was “so exhausted and emotional,” he “sounded like he’d run a marathon at full sprint.”
Behrbom, who lived in Ardsley in Westchester County, had been diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia March 12 — and fell sick from the coronavirus on the last of five days of chemotherapy. He tested positive for COVID-19 a week before his death.
With his immune system devastated by the cancer and chemotherapy, the virus soon left him with “major organ failure to his kidneys, his lungs and his liver,” his brother said.
“There’s only so much you can do when you reach that level,” Cohen said.
Behrbom was “playful and sweet” and “that one person who would always rush to someone’s aid,” his brother said.
He was “always there when I needed him,” Cohen said, recalling their tight bond growing up with their single mom, who is now 71.
“It used to be the three of us together — we were the Three Musketeers,” Cohen said. “Now we lost one.”
As soon as his brother had been diagnosed with cancer, Cohen said, he recalled the painful memory of their mother once telling them how “the worst thing a person can ever experience is losing a child.”
“Now we have finally lost him,” Cohen said.
Cohen said his brother’s family — wife Elizabeth and their kids, Alex, 12, and Eliana, 10 — “meant so much to him.”
“No one will ever be able to fill that void,” Cohen said. “I know that people suffer every day from this virus and it’s something that can’t be quantified.”
Behrbom’s family had managed to line up dozens of potential donors for plasma from those who had recovered from the contagion when they believed it was his only hope for survival.
But despite producing the donors, they were repeatedly denied permission for the treatment — until soon after The Post first contacted the hospital for comment.
While Cohen will now never know whether the hold-up prevented them from saving his brother, he said he is driven to campaign for other families suffering in the same way.
He stressed that his battle with bureaucrats did not taint his amazement at the medical staff putting their own lives at risk to help others during the pandemic.
“I knew they wanted nothing more than to help my brother, to make him better,” he said of the “phenomenal” hospital staff.
“They fought so hard for David. But their hands were tied in a crucial moment.”
White Plains Hospital has told The Post that patient privacy prevents it from providing specific information on the case.
“Like all hospitals across the country, we are actively exploring all treatment options for our patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus, including convalescent plasma therapy,” the hospital said in a statement."
185,Special Passover delivery for homebound Brooklyn Holocaust survivors,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/special-passover-delivery-for-homebound-brooklyn-holocaust-survivors/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Even the coronavirus can’t stop Passover in Brooklyn.
Uber and the nonprofit Met Council are joining forces to deliver 500 Passover meals to homebound Holocaust survivors who will be isolated at home during the upcoming Jewish holiday, the groups told The Post on Sunday.
“It’s a tragedy that these elderly survivors will be all alone for Passover,” David Greenfield of Met Council said in a statement. “That’s why Met Council is working around the clock to try and get to everyone who desperately needs meals.”
The Seder boxes will include all the fixings, from matzah balls, gefilte fish and borscht chicken to sweet potatoes, apples and eggs.
To get the meals to the Holocaust survivors, Met Council, a Jewish nonprofit that operates food pantries and soup kitchens throughout the five boroughs, is teaming up with the ride-hailing app, the statement said.
“Passover seder is a celebration of perseverance and resilience, and that message feels more important now than ever,” said Uber public-affairs manager Hayley Prim. “There’s a lot more that needs to be done for the Met Council and all New Yorkers in need, but we’re proud to play a small role ensuring transportation is not a barrier for Passover seder.”
The move was a welcome gift for local Jewish leaders.
“I think it’s amazing what Met Council is doing,” Alex Budnitskiy, CEO of Marks Jewish Community House of Bensonhurst, told The Post. “I think the fact that they were able to mobilize the community in order to deliver the boxes speaks to how efficient they are and how much they care about the community that they serve.”
According to a 2013 report by Selfhelp Community Services commissioned by Congress, Brooklyn had more than 42,000 of the New York metropolitan area’s Holocaust survivors in 2011, by far the largest concentration of survivors in the region.
The report predicted the number would dwindle to 23,424 in the region by 2025.
The Met Council and Uber effort is just one endeavor to get meals to homebound Jews by the holiday Wednesday.

186,Bronx councilman wants to ban paper bag fee over coronavirus fears,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/bronx-councilman-wants-to-ban-paper-bag-fee-over-coronavirus-fears/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"A Bronx pol plans to introduce legislation to temporarily eliminate the city’s new 5-cent paper-bag fee — because he believes reusable bags are a breeding grounds for germs amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Councilman Mark Gjonaj (D-Bronx) told The Post his bill would suspend the controversial 5-cent fee through the end of 2022.
Mayor Bill de Blasio last year signed into law City Council legislation that set the fee to coincide with a statewide ban of plastic shopping bags.
“I fully support the paper bag fee to encourage New Yorkers to use the more environmentally friendly option of reusable bags in normal times, but the science is clear: reusable bags are more susceptible to carrying the coronavirus,” he said.
“This bill will temporarily lift the fee so that we don’t discourage New Yorkers from using the safer paper bag option during the pandemic.”
Gjonaj cited a 2010 University of Arizona study that showed reusable bags could be a dangerous breeding ground for bacteria and are infrequently washed by owners.
He also said he was inspired by super-liberal San Francisco’s decision last week to temporarily ban reusable bags as a sanitary measure to help curb the spread of the virus.
The councilman said he opted to not push for banning reusable bags in the Big Apple because he believes the full Council is more likely to back waiving the fee for paper bags.
Councilman Brad Lander, the Brooklyn Democrat who led the fight to create the bag fee, did not return a request for comment.
A spokesperson for the mayor said his office would review the legislation once it’s introduced but declined further comment."
187,Mets might be MLB’s biggest loser in the coronavirus era,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/new-york-mets-might-be-mlbs-biggest-loser-amid-coronavirus/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
There are 30 losers. Some lose less, some lose a lot more when it comes to major league teams during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Orioles lose less. They were going to have trouble drawing spectators this year. They get to run time off the horrible contracts of Alex Cobb and, especially, Chris Davis without paying them. No one of too much significance is accruing service time toward arbitration or free agency while games are not played.
The Tigers are in a similar situation, just substitute Jordan Zimmermann and Miguel Cabrera for Cobb and Davis while acknowledging that service time accruing for Matt Boyd is somewhat hurtful.
On the other side, the Dodgers are oft mentioned for being particularly hurt by games being missed and perhaps a season lost to the virus. That revolves mainly around one player — Mookie Betts. He is due to be a free agent following the 2020 season regardless and now may never play a game for the Dodgers after they traded three prospects to Boston for him, plus redirected Kenta Maeda to Minnesota.
But the Dodgers have the young talent and resources to remain a powerhouse even without the prospects or Betts. The lost revenue in the sport likely will drive down free-agent prices at least for the near future, and just a few teams, such as the Dodgers and Yankees, might have the finances to capitalize.
For the Yankees, though, part of the tolerance to stretch to nine years at $324 million for Gerrit Cole was knowing, yeah, they likely would be overpaying over the last few seasons of the contract, but they also would be getting prime years early. Now, Cole’s final season in his 20s is tick, tick, ticking away without games.
Still, the Yankees have talent and resources and — like the Dodgers — a baseball operations department that knows how to assemble a winning team.
The biggest losers are clubs that have pushed so much into the pot for this year or next and do not have strong feeder systems or the financial wherewithal to best withstand things if most, or especially all, of the 2020 major league season is lost. The three that stand out are the Cubs, Reds and Mets.
The Cubs marketed their best players, such as Kris Bryant and Willson Contreras, in the offseason, recognizing they needed to spread payroll around more and deepen their stock of controllable talent. But the Cubs never traded those players, who had two years of service time until free agency. So now, as their control is dwindling even as no games are being played, their value is lower, especially because more teams will lack the revenue to want to take on expensive players.
Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein told me last month the team would decide by the trade deadline if it could win a title and, if not, would be realistic about moving players. Will there even be a trade deadline now with the Cubs facing the core of a champion — Bryant, Contreras, Javy Baez, Jon Lester, Anthony Rizzo and Kyle Schwarber — with expiring contracts after this season or next?
The Reds already gave away two of their better prospects (Jeter Downs and Josiah Gray) to get out of Homer Bailey’s pact last year, and the Dodgers already used Downs as a key to get Betts. The Reds also used touted prospect Taylor Trammell last July to get Trevor Bauer when they weren’t really contenders just so they would have him in his walk year this season. Now, what walk season?
Cincinnati gave matching four-year, $64 million free-agent pacts to Nick Castellanos and Mike Moustakas to try to win now. Would you bet on either aging well? Part of the calculus was at least they had 2020 with those guys to try to end a postseason drought that extends to 2013.
But the Mets might be the big losers. Let us count the ways:
They traded key prospects Jarred Kelenic, Justin Dunn, Anthony Kay and Simeon Woods Richardson for Robinson Cano, Edwin Diaz and Marcus Stroman, and they did not make the playoffs last year. Stroman, like Bauer, was obtained with his 2020 walk year in mind. So either he will pitch less in his walk year or become a free agent without pitching at all.
The trade with the Mariners, already looking disastrous with Kelenic growing into a top prospect while Cano and Diaz faltered last year, can only be revived if the Mets receive a lot out of Cano and Diaz. As one NL executive said of what missing games does to that Mets trade: “It takes an egregious screwup and makes it worse.”
Like Bryant and Contreras, Michael Conforto, Steven Matz and Noah Syndergaard all will be free agents after next season, and the Mets are now losing shrinking time with them. Syndergaard was going to miss this season one way or another after needing Tommy John surgery. But, again, like the Cubs with Bryant and Contreras, the Mets have missed their best window to trade Syndergaard and recoup some of the controllable inventory lost in the Cano, Diaz and Stroman deals.
Also, with no Syndergaard and with Stroman, Rick Porcello and Michael Wacha free agents, the Mets’ rotation to begin 2021 is Jacob deGrom and Matz — and Matz can leave the following offseason. The strength of the team is about to not be that.
DeGrom turns 32 in June. Like Cole with the Yankees, the Mets just don’t want to lose out on any of deGrom’s peak.
One reason the Mets could tolerate some expense and bad contracts is players such as Pete Alonso, Jeff McNeil and J.D. Davis were not yet arbitration eligible. The Mets wasted a cheap season of that trio last year and another could be flitting away now.
If there is a season, the good-faith understanding between the union and MLB is that an attempt will be made to play as many games as possible. That likely will necessitate adding doubleheaders and perhaps removing off days. I would argue that the Mets’ best 1-through-15 are as good as or better than that of any NL team except the Dodgers. And Brodie Van Wagenen has made the Mets a bit deeper than in recent seasons — especially in the bullpen if Dellin Betances is healthy, and Diaz and Jeurys Familia rebound (which was going to be key even in a 162-game campaign).

But depth is still an issue made worse already by the loss of Syndergaard. If teams are going to need to play more games in an abbreviated period, depth is going to be more vital than ever, and depth is not a Mets strength.
One way to create depth if there is a partial 2020 season is to capitalize on an unfortunate situation — that many teams bereft of revenue might have to move contracts even for middling return. But does anyone see the Mets adding to their payroll? Whenever I ask officials around the sport which teams are in the worst financial situation, the Mets routinely come up because they have so much debt and already were going to lose a lot trying to win in 2020. Now, also the value of a franchise the Wilpons are trying to sell may be plummeting.
Might the Wilpons feel with Steve Cohen, like the Cubs with Bryant and Contreras, that their best chance to receive the most for assets — in this case a franchise — came and went in the offseason?
What could financial distress mean for the near future? The Mets can get out of walk-year players such as Stroman, Yoenis Cespedes, Jed Lowrie, Wilson Ramos, Justin Wilson and even any non-insurance payments to David Wright after 2020. But will the lack of revenues this year (even with a partial season, and especially with none) force the Mets to take their 2021 payroll down toward $100 million (or less)?
As one personnel head said, “Their track record is not wanting to spend even in good times.” In which case, can they even make a qualifying offer (roughly $18 million) to Stroman? Would they even tender a contract to Syndergaard (about $10 million) if they thought they were only going to get, say, 15 to 18 starts from him next year and could not trade him for much more than 25 cents on the dollar?"
188,Bronx Zoo tiger tests positive for coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/a-bronx-zoo-tiger-now-has-coronavirus/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"The coronavirus is infecting New Yorkers of all stripes.
A 4-year-old Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the COVID-19 bug after developing a dry cough, the Wildlife Conservation Society said in a statement Sunday.
“Nadia, a 4-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo, has tested positive for COVID-19. She, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers, and three African lions had developed a dry cough and all are expected to recover,” the statement read.
The diagnosis was confirmed by the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa “out of an abundance of caution,” the society said.
The big cats are on the mend, the WCS said.
“Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,” the statement said. “It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.”
The affected big cats are housed in the zoo’s Tiger Mountain exhibit.
None of the other cats at the zoo, which includes leopards, cheetahs and pumas, have shown symptoms, the society said.
Zoo officials said they hope Nadia’s diagnosis “will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world’s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus.”
The zoo has been closed since March 16 due to the spread of the virus.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, animals can become infected by the coronavirus, but scientists don’t believe they can spread the bug to humans.
“In the United States, there is no evidence to suggest that any animals, including pets, livestock or wildlife, might be a source of COVID-19 infection at this time,” according to the CDC.
“However, because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals,” the agency notes."

Even Gov. Andrew Cuomo — and his dog Captain — have the coronavirus isolation blues, the pol said Sunday.
“There’s no medical definition for cabin fever, but I believe it exists,” said Cuomo in his now-daily Albany press briefing.
“The dog is also experiencing cabin fever,” he said in reference to his shepherd-Siberian-malamute mix. “The order of the pack has changed. … He doesn’t know where he fits. He has anxiety.”
Cuomo went so far as to say that being cooped up represents a threat to the very fabric of America.
“Cabin fever in many ways also threatens the essence of our Constitution, which is premised on people ensuring domestic tranquility,” he said. “And it can be disruptive to tranquility, I can attest to that.”
To shake the malaise, Cuomo said, he plans to lace up his running shoes.
“I used to run back in the normal days, before this job,” he said. “But I’m going to start running again [with] my daughter Cara.
“Cara’s got a head start, she’s out there doing 5 miles every day. She thinks she can beat me, I’m going to be right there, right there. Fast like lightning.”"
190,NJ is losing $540M a month in revenue from closed casinos: industry bigs,https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/atlantic-city-casinos-losing-540m-a-month-due-to-coronavirus/,2020-04-05 00:00:00,"The coronavirus could break the house for Atlantic City’s casinos, industry experts and officials say.
The gambling mecca on the Jersey Shore is now virtually a wasteland that is costing the state $540 million in casino-related revenues every month while they remain locked down amid the deadly pandemic, according to the American Gaming Association
Meanwhile, more than 26,000 workers are out of a job, part of a ripple effect that is putting a massive dent in Atlantic City’s $2.9 billion-a-year casino industry.
“We haven’t seen it play out yet, but if you look at the economic numbers that are going to start coming out in the coming weeks, this portends to be a worse economic downturn than we even saw in the great recession,” Clyde Barrow, a professor at University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and an expert on the casino industry, told The Post.
“It will be the biggest blow to the casino industry that we’ve seen in a lifetime,” he said.
In a statement Sunday, Casey Clark, vice president of strategic communications for the gaming association, said he remained hopeful that the casino business would rebound as it did after the recession, calling the industry “incredibly resilient.”
“Right now, we’re focused on working with the federal government so that all corners of the industry — from gaming hubs like Las Vegas and Atlantic City to regional and tribal gaming properties, suppliers and the small businesses that depend on us — have the ability to weather this unprecedented public health crisis,” the statement said.
Nonetheless, the nation’s casinos estimate that they will lose more than $43 billion in revenue over the next two months before the COVID-19 crisis dissipates and the economy begins to try to return to normal, according to a report in The Hill last month.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy ordered all nine of Atlantic City’s casinos to close March 16, just the fifth time the gambling houses had been shut in the 42-year history of legalized gambling in New Jersey, according to a report in the Philadelphia Inquirer.
The last time was for Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when the casinos closed for three days, the report said.
This time, the casinos will remain closed indefinitely, leaving the boardwalk empty and local businesses gambling on their future.
“Nothing is like it was before,” said Jose Torres, 37, of Cafe di Roma on Atlantic Avenue. “Everything has changed. Workers are only working three days as people are scared to come out.”
But “as long as they let us keep open, we’ll stay open,” he said.
Liz Marron, 55, a gas-pump attendant at a Gulf service station on North Fleming Avenue, said, “It’s slow. But we get paid by the hour, thank God for that.”
Liquor-store owner Rajbir Raju said the shuttered casinos have all but killed his business. He used to lock the door at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., but now closes up for the night at 8 p.m.
“No business is the best way to put it,” said Raju, 52. “Because the casinos are closed, even the employees aren’t coming. We are doing nothing.”
According to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, Atlantic City casinos had 26,450 full-and part-time workers when they closed, with the Borgota the largest employer with 5,562 employees.
Barrow said it’s a safe bet the pandemic will put some of the casinos out of business for good.
“That means some casinos won’t survive,” he said. “Some may go into bankruptcy, as happened back in 2006 and 2010” during the recession.
“There will be some losers, and there will be some winners,” he said."

While few details were given, city officials said they are in talks to convert the ship into a medical facility in anticipation of a surge in COVID-19 patients that could overwhelm land hospitals in the weeks ahead, the Long Beach Post reported.
“The City is coordinating plans regarding care facilities and more to ensure that we remain prepared to serve the needs of our community,” Long Beach officials said in a statement. “The Queen Mary remains in consideration, and we will have a plan to announce in the future.”
The British-built vessel is owned by the city, where it has been moored since its retirement in 1967 to serve as a museum, hotel and tourist attraction. There are more than 300 rooms aboard the ship.
The Queen Mary would become the latest floating medical center to join the coast-to-coast battle against the coronavirus following the deployment of two US Navy ships last week.
The USNS Comfort arrived in New York City harbor last week on the front lines of the growing pandemic, while its sister ship, the Mercy, was docked in the Port of Los Angeles. The two ships can each provide up to 1,000 hospital beds for non-coronavirus patients to free up space in land hospitals for those with the disease.

“I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time,’’ the 93-year-old UK monarch said in only the fifth time she has addressed her subjects outside of her annual Christmas speech.
“A time of disruption in the life of our country. A disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.”
The Queen, dressed in green, made a direct comparison to her war-time address in 1940 as then-Princess Elizabeth comforting families devastated early in World War II.
“It reminds me of the very broadcast I made, in 1940, helped by my sister,” she said, with a black and white photograph showing her at the time with sister Princess Margaret.
“We as children spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety.
“Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones,” she said of strict lockdowns enforced in the UK.
“But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.”
She maintained that — just like with a war — her nation must “remain united and resolute then we will overcome it.”
“I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,” she said of the fight against the contagion.
“And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.
“That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet, good-humored resolve, and of fellow feeling, still characterize this country,” she said in the address that aired at 3 p.m. New York time.
“The pride in who we are is not part of our past. It defines our present and our future.”
She stressed that the war on the pandemic was “different” in that it was not one the UK was facing alone.
“This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavor, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed — and that success will belong to every one of us,” she insisted.
She said that “although self-isolating may be hard” it also “presents an opportunity to slow down, pause and reflect in prayer or meditation.”
The Queen made another nod to the war by referring to one of its most famous songs, “We’ll Meet Again” by Vera Lynn.
“We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.
“But for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all,” she said.
As well as thanking healthcare workers and those “who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all,” she also thanked those “who are staying at home, thereby helping to protect the more vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones.”
One government source told The Times of London that ministers hoped the Queen’s words would be their “trump card” in persuading wavering citizens to stick to government guidelines.
Sunday’s address had been pre-recorded at Windsor Castle, where the monarch is staying with her husband Prince Philip, 98.
Just one cameraman — wearing protective gear — was allowed in with her to film in the White Drawing Room, chosen because it is big enough to allow them to have remained far apart. The rest of the crew remained in an adjoining room, listening on speakers.
Her own son, the UK’s 71-year-old heir to the throne, Prince Charles, is one of 48,406 confirmed cases in the UK as of Sunday, with close to 5,000 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The queen usually only broadcasts to the nation with her annual televised Christmas Day message.
The last time she broke that tradition was in 2012 following celebrations to mark her 60th year as queen. That came a decade after the preceding broadcast, which followed the death of her mother, the Queen Mother, in 2002 when she thanked Britons for their messages of condolence.
She also gave an address at the start of the Gulf War in 1991, and most famously, delivered a somber live broadcast after the death of her daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, in a Paris car crash in 1997 amid a national outpouring of grief and criticism of the royal family’s response.

“We have had to make decisions that I personally have never had to contemplate before,” Manhattan Dr. Emile Bacha wrote to friends and coworkers, according to CNN. “We have had to ration care and make decisions about who is considered an urgent or emergent case.”
Bacha — director of pediatric and congenital cardiac surgery at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in Washington Heights — said his pediatric-heart-surgery program is down to one operating team, and “only truly life-threatening problems are allowed.”
“We have to decide what to do about endless other cases, such as shunt-dependent infants, children with ventricular septal defects in heart failure, teenagers with bad valves, and so on — all families in need, looking for our help,” Bacha wrote.
The hospital recently gave new guidelines to its workers saying that nurses must focus on coronavirus care, leaving countless other procedures and surgeries to be postponed or canceled.

His US tour — set to kick off in April at the Coachella music concert in Indio, Calif. — had just been canceled, and his Asia tour had been nixed before that. He was starting to worry that his source of connection to the world — namely, performing music — could be put on hold indefinitely.
“I saw what was happening to the world. Everything was closing down drastically to the point where everyone was going to be stuck inside. Tours were being canceled left, right and center,” said the 22-year-old.
That’s when he decided to put on a variety show centered on live music, but also including a drinking game and a cooking lesson, via YouTube for his house-bound fans. Within 72 hours, Yungblud broadcast the show, which he likened to a “punk rock Jimmy Fallon,” from a Burbank, Calif., studio using a handful of artist pals and a crew outfitted with gloves and masks.
“I had over 300,000 people watch over the hour, which is three f—ing stadiums,” he said. “It is the biggest concert I’ve ever done.”
The musician, who is signed to Universal Music Group’s Interscope and plays before crowds of 2,000 to 10,000, garnered so many views “the show paid for itself” — despite the fact that Google-owned YouTube is known to pay its contributors just a fraction of a penny per view.
The coronavirus pandemic may have brought the curtain down on musical shows around the world, from Dolly Parton to Iron Maiden, but music is still being performed for anyone with access to a smartphone. And while the majority of online music shows are currently being offered free of charge or for charity, the trend is paving the way for a new business model.
“The artist community is going through a very disruptive event, like everyone,” one music executive told The Post. “Most of the activity is focused on charity, but it could be an inflection point in bringing together the audience and the artist for livestreaming to emerge as a business opportunity.”
Some the biggest beneficiaries so far have been tech companies like YouTube, Facebook Live, Instagram’s IGTV and Twitch, which are suddenly streaming live music by the industry’s hottest names, including Elton John, Billy Ray Cyrus, John Legend, Diplo, Marshmello, Miley Cyrus, Dua Lipa and Metallica.
Not to be sidelined, music label Universal Music Group, which reps Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z and Kanye West, is developing a platform for its artists to “syndicate” livestream performances simultaneously across multiple platforms, like YouTube and Facebook Live, a rep from the company told The Post. Artists are expected to start using the platform as early as next week, the rep said.
The service, which has yet to be named, will allow artists to communicate with fans and issue calendar alerts for streaming shows. It will also let them sell merchandise and seek donations to charity.
UMG will undoubtedly create a for-profit revenue model at a later date, but what it will look like is not yet clear. When asked about making money off the service, UMG only said that streaming rights are owned by the label and that royalties are agreed through its contracts.
Bandsintown, a Web site that notifies music fans about when their favorite artists are coming to town, transformed its business in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak into a site that lets artists alert fans about their upcoming streaming gigs.
“We reshuffled the product map in two weeks,” said Fabrice Sergent, co-founder and managing partner of the site, which works with a database of more than 530,000 artists and 55 million fans.
Through a partnership with Twitch — an Amazon-owned platform known for live-streaming people playing video games — Bandsintown musicians can now have fans tune into their Twitch.com channel to see performances, like the March 27 living room dance party with electric dance-pop duo Sofi Tukker.
The platform lets fans watch their favorite artists free of charge and only earns money if viewers “tip” through virtual coins equal to 1 cent per bitcoin. After paying Twitch an undisclosed share of tips, the rest is currently being donated to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, a charity for out-of-work musicians.
“I’m sure we will see a lot of variations in the coming weeks,” Sergent said. Artists, for example, may soon seek to make money by amassing subscribers who pay to be members of their private channel, or through advertising revenue or selling merchandise while streaming.
Yungblud, whose real name is Dominic Richard Harrison, is planning on another YouTube concert from his home studio in London where he is quarantined.
But he hasn’t profited off his live performances, and he’s not planning to so long as the coronavirus outbreak continues and he has food to eat. “It’s not on my radar to make money from that,” he said, before adding: “If I was about to go broke, these performances are a way I could see making money.”
When asked if he sees a future for livestreaming his music in a post-coronavirus world, the singer-songwriter, whose debut single “King Charles” was called “a protest song for the disenfranchised working classes,” didn’t miss a beat.
“Absolutely. I want to make this regularly occurring,” he said. “As soon as everyone gets out, it’s gonna be f—ing pandemonium. It’s gonna be like the ’70s punk movement. It’s gonna be awesome,” he said with some consideration. “I mean, as soon as there’s a vaccination.”"

Then there’s hosting that late-night rendezvous amid a coronavirus lockdown, in flagrant violation of social distancing guidelines.
And then there’s doing that mere hours after going on social media to remind your millions of followers about the importance of following those public health guidelines.
That’s the dubious hat trick apparently “scored” by Manchester City soccer star Kyle Walker, who is apologizing and facing discipline from his Premier League team after one of the escorts blew the lid off the sexcapade in an interview with The Sun.
Louise McNamara, 21, told the newspaper she and another escort, a 24-year-old ­Brazilian woman, were called on the night of March 24 to Walker’s luxury residence outside Manchester, where he was joined by a male friend. She said they arrived around 10:30 p.m. and left around 2 a.m., and the men agreed to pay the women £2,200 (around $2,700) in cash for their services. She supplied details to the tabloid down to Walker’s preferred brand of condom.
The next day, Walker, who also plays for England’s national team as a defender, reportedly was saying, “Stay indoors, keep washing your hands, keep following the protocols and just protect the NHS. It’s been tough, but first and foremost, we have to think about other people’s health and protecting the elderly and family members that can spread it.”

At least he stayed home. Walker denied nothing about the hooker shack-up in a statement that read in part: “I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. As such, I want to apologize to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down.
“And I want to re-iterate the message: Stay home, stay safe.”
According to The Sun, the 29-year-old Walker broke up with his long-term girlfriend earlier this year after the paper reported he got another woman pregnant.
Manchester City issued a classic aware-of-the-situation statement “regarding the private life of Kyle Walker in relation to a breach of the UK lockdown and social distancing rules” and promised “an internal disciplinary procedure.” The Premier League is suspended indefinitely amid the COVID-19 outbreak, and discussions are ongoing about a salary-reduction plan for players."

The number of diagnoses in the five boroughs still rose to 63,767 in the 9:45 a.m. report, a jump of 2,917 from the previous audit released 5 p.m. Saturday.
Queens remains the hardest-hit borough, with 21,342 confirmed cases — followed by Brooklyn with 17,257.
The Bronx is in the middle of the pack with 12,467, then Manhattan with 9,135 and Staten Island with 3,530, the statistics show.
The last time the city saw only a single-digit death toll between updates was March 28 into March 29, when the tally rose from 672 to 678.
By comparison, the city lost 349 New Yorkers in the span of eight-and-a-half hours on Saturday, as the toll spiked from 1,905 to 2,254 between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m.
The pair of fatalities may represent a calm before the storm, as Gov. Andrew Cuomo noted a slight statewide decline in deaths on Sunday — and speculated that the dreaded apex may be upon New York."

Cops broke up a Pink Floyd cover band’s concert — with 30 middle-aged partiers defying lockdown orders — on the front lawn of a New Jersey home over the weekend, authorities said.
Rumson Police said they received a complaint Saturday night about an impromptu concert, which was being broadcast on Facebook Live outside of a home on Blackpoint Road near Wood Lane.
Officers arrived to find two guitarists with microphones and amplifiers playing Pink Floyd’s greatest hits to a group, who were between the ages of 40 to 50 years old.
When authorities ordered the group to leave, the partiers responded by shouting “F–k the police” and “Welcome to Nazi Germany,” according to police.
The band continued to play the song “Wish You Were Here” until they were told to shut down the show, authorities said.
“Sadly I’m sure we all ‘wish we could be here,’ and the Rumson Police Department takes no enjoyment in ruining anyone’s fun!” authorities wrote on Facebook. “However we ALL have a responsibility to take this pandemic SERIOUSLY and adhere to the social distancing requirement.”
The front yard gathering is under investigation and charges are pending, police said.
The concert comes after Gov. Phil Murphy issued a lockdown order that prohibited any parties, celebrations and other social events — and advised residents not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary."
201,New Yorkers are refusing to be hospitalized over fear of getting coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/04/12/coronavirus-fears-have-new-yorkers-avoiding-hospitals-in-nyc/,2020-04-12 00:00:00,"FDNY statistics show that the number of New Yorkers who refuse to be taken to hospitals has more than doubled amid the coronavirus crisis — with EMTs blaming the situation on fear of contracting the deadly disease, The Post has learned.
Year-to-date data show an overall 73 percent increase in 911 calls that resulted in “refusals of medical aid,” or RMAs, with 37,968 cases compared to 21,982 during the same period in 2019.
But during March — when COVID-19 began spreading across the city with a vengeance — RMAs jumped by 118 percent, from 6,777 in 2019 to 14,706 this year.
And during early April, the number skyrocketed from 2,578 to 8,630 — an astonishing 235 percent surge.
One FDNY paramedic said some 911 calls about potentially life-threatening symptoms — such as chest pain — were resulting in patients willing to risk death rather than go to a hospital.
“There are numerous patients refusing because of COVID-19. People have underlying conditions and are refusing transport,” EMT Luis Lopez told The Post.
“Once we evaluate, they often say they are not going to the hospital because of the virus.”
He added: “We always want them to go because if you are calling 911, you obviously felt it was an emergency. But because of conditions [at the hospitals], people are refusing.”
Another FDNY paramedic — Megan Pfeiffer, who works in hard-hit Queens — said she’d encountered similar situations due to the pandemic.
“I had a few that were non-COVID that were hesitant to go to the hospital but we had to take them,” Pfeiffer told The Post.
“Those almost are harder than the COVID patients.”
Pfeiffer was recently featured in a front-page Post report that detailed how the city’s paramedics were essentially performing “battlefield triage” and “pretty much bringing patients to the hospital to die.”
A neurosurgeon at Manhattan’s Mount Sinai Hospital has also tweeted a series of warnings that people with symptoms of a stroke — including the deadliest type, known as emergent large vessel occlusion or ELVO — shouldn’t avoid hospitals.
“People are afraid … past few days we’ve had 3 #stroke patients delay calling EMS for hours because they were afraid to be brought to a hospital,” Dr. J. Mocco wrote on Friday.
Mocco also tweeted that the number of ELVO cases handled by Mount Sinai’s Cerebrovascular Center has nearly doubled — and that he believed strokes were on the rise because COVID-19 “has a pro-inflammatory component.”
“Right now, people keep hearing they should avoid hospitals for non-emergencies, however, strokes are life-threatening,” Mocco told The Post in a direct message over Twitter on Sunday.
“We have to balance the message. Those suffering #BEFAST stroke symptoms are ALWAYS, even during this COVID pandemic, urged to get to the closest ER or call 911.”
“BEFAST” is an acronym referring to key stroke symptoms: balance (dizziness), eyes (sudden vision problems), face (facial weakness), arm (weakness), speech (slurring or speech impairment), time (calling 911 immediately).
FDNY spokesman Frank Dwyer noted that “overall call volume has been up dramatically” this year, with 202,000 year-to-date compared to 167,000 during the same period in 2019.
“So, there could be some correlation there — more overall calls would also lead to more RMAs overall,” he said.

You can spend all day reading and learning and discussing COVID-19, and the way it affects our lives every day. You can spend a portion of every hour doing your part — praying, if that’s your way, or thinking positive thoughts, or keeping the afflicted close to your soul.
And yet it doesn’t feel real until it arrives on your doorstep.
Doesn’t pierce your heart until it knocks on your door.
Doesn’t reveal its true cruel, insidious nature until it becomes a face.
Here at the New York Post, the virus has a face now, and a name. He was Anthony J. Causi, he was a brilliant sports photographer whose pictures brightened these pages for nearly 26 years, whose personality illuminated our lives from the moment our paths first crossed.
There are some people in our lives whose impact is so immediate, and so permanent, it’s all but impossible to remember a time when they weren’t a part of us. That was Anthony. If you worked at The Post, you were family. If you didn’t? That was just a detail. You were family, too.
These last three weeks, Anthony’s fight with COVID-19 has touched all of us in ways that are almost too profound to properly convey. He fought with every ounce of his being, often beyond what seemed possible, but Sunday afternoon, one of the grandest hearts any of us has ever known was stilled.
He was 48. He leaves behind a wife, Romina, his children, John and Mia, and an army of friends that would probably fill Citi Field, Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden. And would probably require standing room, too.
“He had a heart as big as anyone I’ve ever met,” said his longtime friend, Channel 4 sports anchor Bruce Beck. “He was salt of the earth. He had a charm and a grace about him that you just don’t find in many people. He would ask a Roger Clemens or a Pedro Martinez to pose for a picture and they wouldn’t have done that for anybody else. But they did it for Anthony.”
His kindness knew no bounds. A few years ago, YES Network’s Jack Curry and his wife had brought a friend and her daughter, both natives of the island of St. Kitts, to see their first American baseball game at Yankee Stadium. Anthony was working that night and was rushing to man his position on the field when he instantly stopped.
“I have to take a photograph of you,” he announced.
Curry protested, knowing Anthony had to work, but that was a fruitless argument. He unwrapped about 50 pounds of equipment and started shooting: a dozen shots, a hundred, maybe more.
“He wouldn’t stop until he had the perfect shot,” Curry remembered. “And it was perfect.”
We who were privileged to work alongside him understood well that his talent was only matched by a gregarious personality that, somehow, was at once both modest and larger than life. Once, after a team of us covered the Mets’ 2015 NL East clincher, we headed to Montgomery Inn, a Cincinnati staple, for a pile of ribs that reached to the ceiling.
Anthony had as good a day that day as any Met had, because he always did, because when he and his colleague and dear friend Charles Wenzelberg were on top of their games, they could make a newspaper all but jump up and grab your lapels. As the ribs started to vanish, his smile broadened.
“Who has more fun than us?” he asked. “Who’s luckier than us?”
Around Anthony, fun was always a part of the deal. So many of us keep our heads down as we walk through crowded stadiums and arenas; Anthony’s head was always on a swivel, eager to connect with fans. He took thousands of pictures of perfect strangers through the years, took down addresses, sent them prints and emails.
And those photos were taken and presented with as much care, and as much style, as any he took of Derek Jeter, Eli Manning or Pete Alonso.
“He was a fixture,” said Stephen Lynch, The Post’s editor-in-chief. “Do you know how many athletes reached out when they heard he was sick? Players from every team, sending thoughts, hoping he was going to be all right. They all knew him as we did — soft-spoken, kind, professional, funny.”
“And God,” Beck said, “did he love his family.”
All of Anthony’s family — the one at home, the one at The Post, the one that stretched to every corner of New York City — loved him right back. We have all been made dizzy by numbers, by sad stories, by frightening projections. There have been 6,898 deaths in New York City through Sunday. It has been a petrifying number, but just the same only a number.
Now so many of us have a face, and a name, all belonging to a heart whose joy will carry us forever. We lose him too soon. But, damn, being around him was one of life’s true jewels.
Who was luckier than us?
Editor’s note: A GoFundMe account has been set up for the Causi family in the wake of Anthony’s passing. Please find it here. "
203,Heroes of the Day: Coronavirus survivors give blood to help others,https://nypost.com/2020/04/12/heroes-of-the-day-coronavirus-survivors-give-blood-to-help-others/,2020-04-12 00:00:00,"On the last days of Tony Giamei’s life, his fiancee Christy McDonald was on Facebook posting desperate pleas for help.
“The virus is attacking his lungs [and] kidneys and he is still not getting the oxygen his body needs. We are fighting to get him the convalescent plasma,” McDonald’s April 4 post read.
She was referring to an experimental procedure used at some hospitals called plasmapheresis, where antibodies from people who recover from COVID-19 are transferred into critically ill patients in the hope that it will neutralize the virus.
Giamei, 60, had been on a ventilator with COVID-19 for nearly two weeks at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx and was steadily declining after trying two different drug trials, including hydroxychloroquine.
McDonald, 40, had already recovered from the virus and offered her own plasma to his doctors but they said they weren’t participating in the trial, and even if they were, there wasn’t enough evidence to prove it would help.
On Tuesday morning, she was en route to Mount Sinai Hospital for an appointment to have her blood tested for the coveted antibodies when she got the news Giamei had died.
“I’m completely devastated,” McDonald, who lives in the Bronx, told The Post. “But I am going to reschedule that appointment and I am going to donate to any possible hospital that I can in hopes that this does save somebody else’s loved one.”
McDonald is one of thousands of COVID-19 survivors-turned-heroes across the country who are helping scientists find a cure for the pandemic by donating their plasma and participating in research studies.
They call themselves the “Survivor Corps” and in a socially-distanced world, their meeting ground is a Facebook group where lists of plasma donation programs and research studies are regularly published and updated.
“I decided to create the Survivor Corps to bring together all of this, all of these survivors in one place. And we are tracking every study that’s going on around the country,” said the group’s founder Diana Berrent, a Long Island mom who chronicled her own coronavirus journey to The Post with daily diary entries.
Through the budding grassroots network, that’s now grown to nearly 30,000 people, Berrent believes they can change the world.
“So many of the answers to this virus are in the bodies of the survivors,” Berrent said, adding one plasma donation can be used on at least three patients.
“We as a collective community can really turn the tide of this pandemic.”
Mount Sinai Hospital was one of the first hospitals nationwide to start a plasmapheresis program back on March 24 after one of its microbiologists came up with a test for the virus antibodies and saw similar programs in China were successful.
“Treating people with plasma is not a new thing. It has been used in viruses in the past, like for a hundred years. The idea is that we take somebody who’s fully recovered, whose body has fought off the infection by making antibodies. Antibodies live in plasma in the blood,” explained Dr. Ania Wajnberg, who’s running the hospital’s plasma donation program.
“So presumably, if we take the antibodies in the plasma from somebody who has recovered, we can give them to somebody who’s severely ill, and try to kind of jumpstart their body to be able to fight off the infection.”
The Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment on an emergency basis and the hospital has tried the procedure on more than 20 “severely ill” patients, Wajnberg said.
Mount Sinai wouldn’t comment on how its patients are doing because it’s “too early” to tell — though one Maryland hospital tweeted earlier this month that five patients who received plasma had improved.
The program would be impossible without COVID-19 survivors willing to donate.
“They are having a potentially direct impact to help another sick person,” Wajnberg said. “Also, they’re helping us understand so much about the body’s response to this disease, and what potential treatment options and then further down the line, how immunity can help us reopen our society and get people back to work.”
So far, more than 22,000 survivors have answered Mount Sinai’s calls for donations and around 2,500 have been tested to see if they have the antibodies. Wajnberg and her team have identified over 130 donors and that number is growing “more and more everyday.”
Jeffrey Yonkers, a 50-year-old CPA from Long Island, is one of those donors.
“I am super excited,” Yonkers told The Post after he found out he was cleared for plasma donation at Mount Sinai.  “I could cry.”
The family-man accountant heard about the program through media reports and felt compelled to help after beating the bug.
He went to Mount Sinai to have his blood tested and has now been cleared to donate plasma through the New York Blood Center. He’ll be screened and then hooked up to an IV for about an hour and a half so doctors can separate his red blood cells from the yellowish plasma fluid.
“God forbid, it was my wife that needed it. Or my family member,” Yonkers, who has an asthmatic son, said by phone.
“I always feel like I’ve been fortunate in life. So I try to give back.”
Jane Grauer, 62, and her husband Josh Grauer were part of the original cluster of coronavirus cases that sprouted in Westchester County after attending a service at the Young Israel of New Rochelle synagogue.
She battled the virus for nearly three weeks and said the experience was “like having the flu on steroids times infinity.”
For her, the hardest part came when she finally took a shower after weeks of baths.
“I couldn’t lift my arms to shampoo my hair, and I started to cry. That was like my lowest moment,” Grauer, a kindergarten teacher, recalled.
“And then I’m like, ‘well shut up’ you know, ‘you’re alive.’”
It’s that attitude that compelled her to sign up for plasma donations after she finally tested negative for the virus on March 30.
“I didn’t die and I’m so grateful to be alive. And I’m so grateful that my husband is alive. It’s incumbent on us to help other people who might literally have their lives saved,” Grauer said.
She’s been cleared to donate plasma through Montefiore Medical Center and is in the process of setting up an appointment now.
Shirley, Long Island resident Debra Tavarone, 55, lost her brother-in-law to COVID-19 on March 16 and contracted the bug while treating her mother and father-in-laws, who’d also caught the virus.
“It literally took my breath away,” Tavarone told The Post. “I think I had every symptom there could have possibly been except for, you know, dying. It was pretty bad.”
When she heard about the plasma program, she knew she had to sign up.
“This is huge,” the mom of two said. “If I could save somebody that is on life support now, even if I could save one person, I’d feel blessed.”
She’s working with Mount Sinai hospital now to get tested for the antibodies.
For Julie Thaler, who was also part of the original cluster of Westchester infections, signing up to donate plasma “wasn’t even a question.”
“I truly believe that I am on my way to saving lives,” Thaler, 57, told The Post as she geared up to donate Friday through Columbia University after fighting the virus for nearly a month.
“It’s critical. The light at the end of this tunnel of this long debilitating illness is that you can help to save lives and we possess antibodies that can do that,” Thaler said.
“This is such a huge unknown. Which is why people like me and other survivors need to help scientists answer these questions.”
For viruses that have been fully studied, developing antibodies typically means immunity but Wajnberg said it’s still not clear if that’s the case with COVID-19 survivors.
It’s also not clear how long the antibodies, and immunity, will remain in their system. Even though the U.S. and China haven’t seen reinfections on a “wide scale,” more research needs to be done to see the program’s true impact and survivors still need to take precautions, Wajnberg said.
But as hundreds of people die everyday from the virus, and doctors work around the clock to slow those numbers, Berrent believes the survivors and their willingness to help scientists find answers “is the epicenter of hope.”
“And I think that that’s really powerful,” said Berrent, who was participant #001 at Columbia University’s plasma donation program.
“Because there’s nothing we need more as a global community than hope.”

NEW YORK — More than 3,300 deaths nationwide have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, an alarming rise in just the past two weeks, according to the latest count by The Associated Press.
Because the federal government has not been releasing a count of its own, the AP has kept its own running tally based on media reports and state health departments. The latest count of at least 3,323 deaths is up from about 450 deaths just 10 days ago.
But the true toll among the 1 million mostly frail and elderly people who live in such facilities is likely much higher, experts say, because most state counts don’t include those who died without ever being tested for COVID-19.
Outbreaks in just the past few weeks have included one at a nursing home in suburban Richmond, Virginia, that has killed 42 and infected more than 100, another at a nursing home in central Indiana that has killed 24 and infected 16, and one at a veteran’s home in Holyoke, Mass., that has killed 37, infected 76 and prompted a federal investigation. This comes weeks after an outbreak at a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland that has so far claimed 43 lives.
And those are just the outbreaks we know about. Most states provide only total numbers of nursing home deaths and don’t give details of specific outbreaks. Notable among them is the nation’s leader, New York, which accounts for 1,880 nursing home deaths out of about 96,000 total residents but has so far declined to detail specific outbreaks, citing privacy concerns.
Experts say nursing home deaths may keep climbing because of chronic staffing shortages that have been made worse by the coronavirus crisis, a shortage of protective supplies and a continued lack of available testing.
And the deaths have skyrocketed despite steps taken by the federal government in mid-March to bar visitors, cease all group activities, and require that every worker be screened for fever or respiratory symptoms at every shift.
But an AP report earlier this month found that infections were continuing to find their way into nursing homes because such screenings didn’t catch people who were infected but asymptomatic. Several large outbreaks were blamed on such spreaders, including infected health workers who worked at several different nursing home facilities.
This past week, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that regulates nursing homes issued recommendations urging nursing homes to use separate staffing teams for residents, and to designate separate facilities within nursing homes to keep COVID-19 positive residents away from those who have tested negative.
Dr. Deborah Birx, who leads the White House coronavirus response, suggested this past week that as more COVID-19 tests become available, nursing homes should be a top priority.
“We need to really ensure that nursing homes have sentinel surveillance. And what do I mean by that? That we’re actively testing in nursing homes, both the residents and the workers, at all times,” Birx said."

The state reported a new Big Apple tally of 103,208 Sunday, or 4,900 overnight.
The city also saw another 531 deaths in the past 24 hours, for a grim total of 6,898, state authorities said.
The city — which keeps its own, separate tally — had counted 104,410 cases but 6,182 deaths as of 5 p.m. Sunday.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that statistics related to the contagion are “flattening” across the state — but warned that New York’s suburbs and rural areas are the next to be hit.
The bulk of both the state’s virus cases and deaths have predominantly been in the Big Apple."

The coronavirus can travel through the air at least 13 feet — more than twice as far as social distancing guidelines, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Research published in the federal agency’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal shows the contagion spreading much farther than previous official suggestions — and also getting spread on people’s shoes.
“The aerosol distribution characteristics … indicate that the transmission distance of [COVID-19] might be 4 m,” the report says, translating as more than 13 feet.
“Furthermore, half of the samples from the soles of the ICU medical staff shoes tested positive,” the researchers wrote of samples taken at Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan.
“Therefore, the soles of medical staff shoes might function as carriers.”
The report, based on research by a team at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, appears to reaffirm fears that the current social distancing guidelines of 6 feet may not be enough.
It also suggests people — especially medical staff on the front lines — could inadvertently be spreading the bug away from its source, recommending stringent disinfecting measures.
High levels were also found on frequently touched surfaces like computer mice, trash cans and bed rails.
The CDC recommends 6 feet for social distancing, while the World Health Organization claims just 3 feet should be enough, less than a quarter of the distance the current study suggests the bug spreads.
Research last month said the virus could travel up to 27 feet. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, called that “terribly misleading,” saying it would require a “very, very robust, vigorous, achoo sneeze” to travel that far and the scenario was “not practical.”"

Health care workers on Sunday faced off against protesters calling for an end to Colorado’s coronavirus stay-at-home order.
Two medical workers in scrubs and N95 masks were spotted blocking horn-honking motorists who had gathered at the State Capitol in Denver to challenge the mitigation methods, photos and videos posted on social media show.
“They were blocking the roads until the police force stepped in,” photojournalist Alyson McClaran, who posted images of the exchange on Facebook, told the New York Times.
“People were putting their cars right up against them.”
Video of the incident showed a woman in an American flag T-shirt hanging out of her car window to yell at the health care workers.
“Go to China if you want communism,” she says, over loud honking.
“You can go to work, why can’t I go to work?” the woman asks, referring to the closure of non-essential businesses in the state.
The workers didn’t appear to respond.
Several hundred demonstrators lined the streets to the city in their vehicles while honking their horns before circling it as pedestrians.
Many waved American flags and held signs that read “End the Virus, Not the Economy” and “We need stability to stay healthy,” according to the Denver Post."

Rated PG
Streaming: Netflix
With everyone in a Michael Jordan mood with the release Sunday of ESPN’s highly anticipated 10-part documentary “The Last Dance,” His Airness’ big-screen debut seemed to be the natural selection.
No, it certainly is not the finest piece of cinematic art in this genre, but a generation of kids and their parents who grew up watching respective icons Bugs Bunny, Bill Murray and Michael Jordan certainly will never forget them teaming up for this partially animated tour de force.
Produced by Ivan Reitman — who’d worked with Murray on “Stripes” and “Ghostbusters” in the ’80s — “Space Jam” provides a fantasy-based account of the period between Jordan’s first retirement from the NBA in 1993 and his triumphant return to the league to win the final three of his six league championships with the Chicago Bulls in 1995.
Jordan’s lone year playing minor league baseball with the White Sox organization is presented as the reason a group of unknowing aliens zap the skills from Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Larry Johnson, Muggsy Bogues and Shawn Bradley to create the ringer team known as the Monstars, rather than steal them from the greatest player in hoops history.
Instead, Looney Tunes legends Bugs and Daffy Duck recruit — OK, kidnap — Michael from a golf game with Murray, Larry Bird and Wayne Knight (Newman from Seinfeld) — to help them win a basketball game against the Monstars to escape enslavement by evil Mr. Swackhammer (voiced by Danny DeVito) as attractions at his failing outer-space amusement park Moron Mountain.
“But I’m a baseball player now,” Jordan argues.
“Right, and I’m a Shakespearean actor,” Bugs Bunny replies.
Of course, Jordan and his cartoon teammates pull off a second-half comeback to emerge victorious after he and Bugs convince Porky Pig, Yosemite Sam, Lola Bunny, etc., to drink “Michael’s Secret Stuff,” a placebo-effect bottle of water.
(Note: The sequel starring LeBron James — 25 years later — is due out in July 2021.)
Quote of Note: “Whoa, whoa, whoa! I didn’t know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture!” Mr. Swackhammer when Bill Murray enters the game against the Monstars.

On the eve of her 90th birthday, with her lavish party plans kaput, Cindy Adams gives New Yorkers a master class in how to survive a lockdown with your sense of humor intact.
Instead of sitting on a red and gold throne, wearing a 24-carat gold dress, entertaining 500 celebrity friends at the party of the decade Friday, Adams laments that she is schlepping around her apartment in a schmatta, cleaning up pee off the kitchen floor from her “new Yawkie” dog while her live-in Guyanese housekeeper keeps wanting to make her goat curry.
What would her late husband, comedian Joey Adams, make of it all?
“I remember on my 21st birthday, Joey gave me a full-length chinchilla fur coat with a diamond bracelet in the pocket,” she says. “And this year, I’m going to stay home in a schmatta.”
The baggy outfit was a gift from Dr. Daniel Baker, plastic surgeon to the stars, and also to the Saudi Arabian royal family. He had 25 Middle Eastern galabeyas made for her in Egypt and they have become her go-to attire during the lockdown in her Park Avenue penthouse.
“I was given a chinchilla and a diamond bracelet. Now I am wearing a long, full-length white schmatta, my brown charming hair now has a white ruff around it like Santa Claus, and my nails are all broken. I have one in the middle, which I’m now using to spear food.
“My big thing this morning was my dog peed all over my kitchen. So, my dog is 6 months old, does not yet have his manners. And instead of preening over 500 people on my guest list, I am wiping up dog pee on the kitchen floor.”
Her column hasn’t skipped a beat during five weeks “blockaded at home.” The phone still rings with tips as she taps on a laptop in a study festooned, wall and ceiling, with her 500 New York Post front page scoops: “WOODY’S BEING FRAMED!” “DI’S DRIVER WAS DRUNK!”
Last week, she wrote about sitting around watching old movies, like the rest of us. Only this was “The Apartment,” starring her friend Shirley MacLaine. “I then called Shirley,” she wrote.
Hilarity ensued, another gift from a bulging contact book, curated over the four decades she has written for The Post.
A one-time Miss Bagel, biographer of Indonesian President Sukarno, confidante of presidents and cardinals, best friend of Judge Judy, she is wistful for her city.
“New York to me is my religion. I’m a devout New Yorker. I have been all over the world … to Siberia, to the outback, to the Galapagos, and there is no place in the world that I would ever live but New York.
“However, when you look at it now, it is a ghost city,” she said.
“When I look out now, usually we can’t cross the street. Now, there’s only one person on a bicycle.”
Her building has emptied out and friends have decamped for the Hamptons or Florida.
Has she thought about how the city will be after the virus?
“I don’t think it will return the way that it was,” she said. “But will New York come back? You’re never going to make New York in Colorado, honey. And there ain’t no one rushing to Milwaukee, either. So eventually, it will be New York. But it’s not going to be in a hurry.”
Her party was to have been in Hell’s Kitchen in a grand space festooned with her front pages and decorated like Central Park.
There would have been original 1930s menus from Schrafft’s and, for dessert, Gristedes owner John Catsimatidis had found her 500 boxes of animal crackers to serve with ice cream in Dixie cups and a wooden spoon.
In the center of every table there was to be a huge tureen with 1930s penny candy, chocolate kisses, licorice and bubble gum.
The waiters were to be dressed as old-school newspaper men with little press passes in their fedoras, and Cindy would preside over it all from her red and gold throne.
“There was no limit to what I was going through with this particular birthday show. I have spent a fortune on this. I cannot begin to tell you.”
Her friends feel sorry for her, so they’ve been sending over gifts.
“Randy Levine, president of the Yankees, sent me a huge cake from Goldbelly. His wife, Mindy, she sent me steaks from Omaha. Francine LeFrak sent me a fish. A foot doctor called Rock Positano, he sent me a bottle of wine.
“So instead of a throne and dining with 500 people including — I’m not saying that they had said yes or no yet — the president, our mayor, our governor, our cardinal . . . Instead, I am having a cake from Goldbelly, a steak from Omaha, a raw fish and a bottle of wine, all alone with my housekeeper who’s going to suggest I have goat curry. That’s her idea of a birthday event.
“Oh, well, you can’t plan everything. Life throws you curveballs.”
So we leave Cindy, at home in her schmatta, wisecracking all the way to 90, and we just know New York will be OK in the end.
What the hell was Dr. Anthony Fauci thinking when he gave the wink to Tinder hook-ups?
On a Snapchat show aimed at young people, the nation’s health czar was asked what advice he would give to someone considering “swiping on a dating app like Tinder or Bumble or Grindr” and inviting a stranger over.
Fauci was astonishingly insouciant: “If you’re willing to take a risk, and you know, everybody has their own tolerance for risks … If you want to go a little bit more intimate, well, then that’s your choice regarding risk.”
On his advice, the country has been shut down for five weeks, 17 million Americans have filed for unemployment, businesses have closed that will never come back.
Yet the White House pandemic adviser, who once told us we may never shake hands again, now gives a wink and a nod to sex with strangers.
It’s irresponsible and makes you question his judgment on other matters.
Nancy Pelosi is the Marie Antoinette of the global pandemic. She sits in the kitchen of her San Francisco mansion in front of her $24,000 Sub-Zero refrigerators, showing off a freezer drawer stuffed with $13 ice creams, while businesses crash and millions lose their jobs.
“Let them eat Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams” is her message, as she stalls the small-business relief package, the Paycheck Protection Program, unless she gets to fund her irrelevant pet projects.
She says of small businesses, “They will have more money as soon as we come to an agreement.”
They can’t wait. Doesn’t she get it?
Then she has the hide to go on “Fox News Sunday” and grade President Trump an “F” for his handling of the crisis.
This is the woman who urged people to come out to Chinatown en masse on Feb. 24. That was two weeks after Trump banned flights from China, and she was trying to make some point about racism.
It’s never about the American people with Pelosi, just petty one-upmanship."
211,"NYC soup kitchens are now serving grad students, actors and musicians",https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/food-banks-feeding-more-people-amid-coronavirus-unemployment-crisis/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"The vast ranks of newly unemployed are straining the capacities of food banks, soup kitchens and pop-up services across New York City.
One user, Brittany, a 35-year-old Ph.D. candidate at Teachers College at Columbia University, who declined to give her full name, says she started visiting food services at Salem United Methodist Church in Harlem a few weeks ago after her partner lost his bartending job.
“I’ve been going two or three times a week for lunch,” she told Side Dish. “The fresh air makes it seem a little less scary.”
She’s just one of hundreds of neighborhood newcomers — including actors, writers, students, musicians and artists — to have sought help there in the wake of coronavirus layoffs, said Winston Majette, executive director of the Harlem chamber of commerce.
“That’s the dynamic in just two weeks,” Majette said.
City Harvest, a nonprofit that distributes food donated by restaurants and other retail outlets to nearly 250 food pantries and soup kitchens citywide, says it delivered 6.6 million pounds of food between March 9 and April 12, or almost 5 million pounds more than the year-earlier period, according to Racine Lee Droz, City Harvest’s director of food sourcing.
“Before COVID, we saw the same faces every week. Now we see lots of families with young children.”
Food Bank for New York City — the biggest anti-hunger organization in the city — says the number of users could double or even triple from the pre-coronavirus level of 2.5 million.
“In Richmond Hills, Queens, at the River Fund, we had an agency serving 1,000 to 1,500 people before COVID,” said Leslie Gordon, Food Bank’s president and chief executive. “It’s now going up to 5,000 people in line and that could continue to grow. This is not unique. It’s a bellwether for what is happening across New York City.”
As of last week, 791,000 New Yorkers had applied for unemployment benefits, according to the Department of Labor. A New School study found that the state has lost 1.2 million jobs so far, and estimates that one-third of the city could soon be out of work.
On Wednesday, Mayor de Blasio announced a plan to spend $170 million on food for the hungry. “People are literally asking, ‘Where is my next meal coming from?’,” de Blasio said.
Before COVID-19, Salem United Methodist Church had its own soup kitchen, which delivered 500 meals three times a week. But many of its volunteers were elderly and couldn’t work during the pandemic.
Now, Rethink Food, a local nonprofit, has launched a pop-up soup kitchen outside the church and is doing 600 to 1,000 meals a day, five days a week. “We could easily do 5,000 meals a day,” Rethink founder Matt Jozwiak said — and lines would be even longer if it weren’t for fear of infection.
Kumbe, a 52-year-old mother of four from the Ivory Coast who recently lost her job as a caregiver and declined to give her full name, came to the pop-up Friday with her 16-year-old son to grab meals for the family. “Before, I had a job,” she said. “Now, I don’t have anything. I am afraid.”
Diana Lee, founder of the Do-Good Auto Coalition, whose sponsors include Maserati, led a convoy of five cars — including two Maseratis — last week to deliver 2,500 pounds of food from three currently shuttered Pret a Manger outlets to a food pantry operated by the BedStuy Campaign To End Hunger.
“I felt like I had landed in a war zone,” Lee said. “There were hundreds of people lined up around the block. They were fighting for food, shouting at each other when they thought some people were taking too much. It was really hard. I’ve never seen anything like it. By the time we unloaded all of the food, 75 percent of it was already gone.”
Robert Lee, who heads Rescuing Leftover Cuisine, said restaurant-donation pickups from places like Pret A Manger and Paris Baguette, as well as from food manufacturers for airlines, are new and helping to meet the increased demand. “People are demanding that their communities help them. The lines are insane.”
City Harvest’s Droz says the group is bracing for the situation to get worse in the weeks and months to come. “The need will last far longer than when the government reopens the city because so many people are unemployed,” she said. “We plan on operating this way until the end of September.”"

President Trump on Sunday responded to questions about protests against coronavirus restrictions by saying he believes some governors have gone too far with the measures.
“You are allowed to protest,” the president said during a White House briefing on the pandemic.
“Some have gone too far, some governors have gone too far. Some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate,” Trump continued.
“And I think in the end it’s not going to matter because we’re starting to open up our states, and I think they’re going to open up very well.”
“As far as protesters, you know, I see protesters for all sorts of things,” he added. “And I’m with everybody. I’m with everybody.”
The comments echoed statements Trump made at Saturday’s briefing, where he spoke out in support of the protests, many of which flout the social distancing guidelines the White House put in place to curb the outbreak.

Trump was also asked whether he worried that his calls to “liberate” Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia on Friday could incite violence, as the governors of those states have reportedly been receiving death threats. 
“I’ve seen the people. I’ve seen interviews of the people. These are great people,” he said about the protesters.
“They have got cabin fever,” Trump said. “Their life was taken away from them … These people love our country, they want to get back to work.”"

The director of a lab studying the coronavirus in Wuhan — the Chinese city where the global outbreak is believed to have originated — denied that the bug accidentally spread from his facility.
“There’s no way this virus came from us,” Yuan Zhiming, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, told state media on Saturday.
Yuan’s denial came days after a fresh round of reports suggesting the novel coronavirus escaped from the Wuhan Institute or another similar laboratory miles away in the Chinese city.
President Trump was asked about the possibility at a White House press briefing last Wednesday and said the US was investigating the origins.
“More and more we’re hearing the story … we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation,” the president said.
Two reports — one by Fox News and another in the Washington Post — followed, quoting anonymous sources raising concerns that the virus may have accidentally escaped from the facility.
Yuan admitted that the lab is studying “different areas related to the coronavirus,” but told the English-language state broadcaster CGTN that none of his staff has been infected.
“As people who carry out viral studies we clearly know what kind of research is going on at the institute and how the institute manages viruses and samples,” he said.
He said that since the lab is in Wuhan “people can’t help but make associations”, but claimed that some media outlets are “deliberately trying to mislead people”.
But officials in the past have raised concerns over the safety conditions of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
In March 2018, US science diplomats dispatched to the lab issued two “sensitive” diplomatic cables about inadequate safety measures at the lab, the Washington Post reported, citing intelligence sources.
The first cable warned the experiments conducted in the lab on coronavirus in bats “represented a risk of a new SARS-like pandemic,” according to the report.
The cable, written by two US-China embassy officials, said there is a “serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” according to the report.

The Athletic first reported Manfred’s intentions.
No team has to impose furloughs or reductions and clubs such as the Braves, Giants and Phillies have already let non-playing employees covered by the UEC know that they will be paid through May. But there were organizations that were anticipating the financial crunch and were not initially supportive of paying employees even in April without games and, thus, revenue coming in.
There is a provision within the UEC that permits the commissioner to withhold pay in case of a national emergency. President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13. Initially, Manfred did not want to impose the rule. But with games not being played in April, doubtful for May and the season in question overall, he is now going to arm organizations with a method to save money.
The UEC mainly covers major and minor league managers, coaches and scouts."

Sentenced as a juvenile, William Garrison served nearly 44 years of his sentence before succumbing to the virus. Garrison’s bunkmate found him struggling to breathe on Monday night in their two-man cell at Macomb Correctional Facility.’
Garrison was charged with life in prison after a 1976 home invasion resulted in Garrison shooting and killing a man at the age of 16. His sentence was cut in half in January, and he was offered the choice of an immediate release on parole or release without parole in September.
Garrison chose the latter.
Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman Chris Gautz issued a statement to the Detroit Free Press regarding Garrison’s passing.
Gautz claimed the prison staff went cell to cell to assess prisoners in the days before Garrison died, and Garrison’s bunkmate claimed he did not suffer from any COVID-19 symptoms besides a cough.
But Garrison’s sister, who was preparing for him to live with her following his release in early May, disputes their accounts of events.
“My brother shouldn’t have died in there like that,” Yolanda Peterson told the Detroit Free Press. “He was trying to get free.”
Garrison had appealed for an early release to avoid the COVID-19 outbreak at Macomb. Gautz claimed a post-mortem autopsy confirmed Garrison had coronavirus, while a test confirmed that Garrison’s bunkmate was negative.
Gautz called the situation “unfortunate all the way around,” noting that Garrison could have paroled earlier this year.
As of Sunday, Michigan has seen at least 30,791 confirmed coronavirus cases and 2,308 deaths. Michigan has recently seen a drop in new cases, falling from the third-most infected state to the fifth-most over the past few days."

Rebecca Seawright, who represents 133,000 constituents in the 76th District on the Upper East Side and Roosevelt Island, failed to include the cover sheet when she submitted her petitions confirming that she had collected enough Democratic voter signatures to get on the ballot, the sources said.
She also didn’t have a signed “certificate of acceptance” to allow her to run under the Working Families Party, they said.
Seawright could be prevented from running for re-election in the seat she has held since 2014 because the Board of Elections’ legal staff is recommending she be knocked off the ballot for the violation, the sources said.
The board is due to hear her case on Tuesday.
Her opponent, Republican Lou Puliafito, has also filed a legal challenge in Manhattan Supreme Court to prevent her from running.
“Theoretically, this is something that is not curable. If board members follow the law, Seawright is in trouble,” said one board member, who requested anonymity so as not to be accused of prejudging the lawmaker’s case.
“It’s very unusual for something like this to happen to an incumbent,” the member said of Seawright’s errors.
Seawright missed some crucial time during the petition gathering period last month because she was ill with what her campaign says were “Covid-like symptoms,” but still comfortably got more than enough signatures to get on the ballot, the sources say.
Although she didn’t have the virus, it could be her one hope for salvation, if officials decide to relax the usually strict regulations because of the chaos the pandemic has caused, the sources say.
Insiders point out that other regulations have been relaxed, including the number of signatures required to get on the ballot. The minimum was reduced from 500 to 150.
“You can’t underestimate the COVID pandemic for our lives in general,” the source on the board said.
In a statement to The Post, Seawright’s campaign said: “Like so many New Yorkers upended by the Covid-19 pandemic, Rebecca contracted an infectious and contagious virus with Covid-like symptoms and was placed under doctors’ care precisely at the time the filing was due.”
“Assemblymember Seawright . . . has retained legal counsel to ensure that every voice is heard. Voters from the Upper East Side, Yorkville and Roosevelt Island must not be denied their right to consider her candidacy on the Democratic Party line in the June 23 primary elections,” it continued.
Puliafito, 62, said “there’s no excuse” for Seawright not to file her cover sheet with her petitions.
“Seawright had the Democratic machine behind her. She could have reached out to someone to help her,” Puliafito said.
“It’s a shame that she was sick but that’s no excuse for her not to delegate someone to do it for her. She handed in her voter signatures to the election board didn’t she?”
Puliafito, an apartment building doorman, also said he too was self-quarantined with COVID-like symptoms from March 24 to April 15.
“Rebecca Seawright is a dedicated public servant, a good Democrat committed to moving our state forward and a reliable partner in fighting for New York families. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, she had worked to get nurses and doctors in her district the PPE they need to fight the virus safely,” Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) said in a statement. 
“She is also a champion for women, ensuring critical screenings are covered by insurance companies and passing the Equal Rights Amendment in the Assembly. Rebecca is a colleague, a friend and a trusted part of our team.“"
217,City DOE postpones vote on millions in vendor contracts,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/city-doe-postpones-vote-on-millions-in-vendor-contracts/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The city Department of Education is putting the brakes on millions of dollars in contracts that critics call outrageous spending amid a dire cash crunch, The Post has learned.
The DOE was poised to plunk down up to $700 million alone to keep bus companies on standby through June, despite the closure of school buildings since March 13 amid the coronavirus crisis.
But after The Post revealed the mind-boggling planned expenditure — and Mayor Bill de Blasio warned that the schools’ budget would be cut by $827 millions through next year thanks to lost revenue from the pandemic — City Hall moved to at least postpone a vote on the bus contracts and a slew of others, sources said Sunday.
“The DOE should look at every single one of these contracts in light of what we’re experiencing: Is it absolutely necessary? Is it critical for kids? And are we using the services now?” said Leonie Haimson, executive director of Class Size Matters and a school-budget watchdog..
“If the answer to any one of these questions is no, they should cancel or eliminate the contracts.
“We’re facing a fiscal crisis, and we’re wasting millions of dollars for no reason,’’ Haimson said.
A vote on the proposed new contracts and extensions is now off the table until April 29, said Isaac Carmignani, a member of the DOE’s Panel for Educational Policy, which reviews expenditures for the department.
“It’s either to get more answers … or some things might be pulled,’’ he said of the extra time to mull over the deals.
As for the bus contracts, “I want to see something for our money,’’ Carmignani said.
The department also wants to award contracts to spend up to $4.5 million a month through June on private companies to supply up to 350 nurses. Currently, the DOE is paying for only 35 contracted nurses to staff centers for children of first-responders and health-care workers, a spokeswoman aaid.
But the DOE has 500 nurses on its own payroll, with only half of them working in the centers or in hospitals. The department could not explain why the contracted nurses are needed while some 250 school nurses are sidelined.
“I have no idea why they would need to hire more nurses right now,’’ said Kimberly Watkins, president of Community Education Council 3, the parent advisory group covering schools on the Upper West Side and in Harlem.
“You would think the DOE nurse pool would be sufficient,’’ Watkins said.
The department also was set to ink a $40 million contract with IBM to install a data-storing SIM card and software in each of the 300,000 iPads the DOE it is buying from Apple for students without an online device.
A DOE spokeswoman would not say how much the DOE is shelling out for the iPads, but a City Council source said it’s $189 million — or about $630 per device.
Other contracts would allow the DOE to pay vendors millions of dollars for “professional development’’ for educators.
Also up for a vote was a two-month, $1.2 million contract with Accenture, a private firm, to provide “management consulting” on issues related to COVID-19. The DOE would not give the firm’s hourly rate.
The DOE has been asked to consult the city’s Office of Management and Budget on the proposed deals, Carmignani said.
Mayoral spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said, “At the request of the mayor, we have postponed the meeting while we review the bus contracts.”
She declined to comment further."
218,New York to begin coronavirus antibody testing survey on Monday,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/new-york-to-begin-coronavirus-antibody-testing-survey-on-monday/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
New York state on Monday will begin conducting antibody tests to help determine how many New Yorkers were infected by the disease, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday.
A sample of 3,000 state residents will start receiving tests from the state Department of Health to detect the presence of antibodies produced by people infected with COVID-19, Cuomo said.
The governor’s office noted that Germany — with a population of 83 million to New York’s 19.5 million — used the same sample size for its antibody testing survey.
“This will be the first true snapshot of exactly how many people were infected by COVID-19,” the governor said in a statement.
The testing, Cuomo said, “will help us to reopen and rebuild without jeopardizing what we’ve already accomplished.”
Testing positive for coronavirus antibodies does not prove immunity, the World Health Organization said Friday."
219,RJ Barrett’s bizarre coronavirus world involves big donations,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/knicks-rj-barretts-bizarre-coronavirus-world-includes-big-donations/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Last week, Knicks rookie RJ Barrett went to pick up a package for his grandmother. He didn’t even get out of the car, but someone recognized him from afar. And it blew his mind.
“I really forgot that I play in the NBA,” he tells The Post. “It’s such a different reality that we’re in right now.”
The 19-year-old is riding out the coronavirus lockdown with his family in Orlando, Fla., playing video games, chilling with his French bulldogs, Kobe and Kingston, and bonding with his little brother, Nathan. It’s a bizarre new world for the 6-foot-7 shooting guard who only knows the frenetic pace of a ballplayer’s life. But while he had to shake the cobwebs to remember his status as one of league’s promising young stars, he has not forgotten his adopted hometown of New York and all of the people frantically fighting to keep the city whole as it remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I have been following social media and watching the news, seeing how things have been getting drastically worse. What really struck me is all of the workers in the hospital. These people are risking their lives and they go home and stay in the same house as their family and kids. I wanted to see what I could do to help,” said Barrett, who was particularly heartbroken to see coverage of Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center in Brownsville, a facility so overwhelmed by the deadly virus that an ER doctor there called it a “medical war zone.”
“My mom grew up in Brooklyn. My family is there, and it hit me a little extra harder. We need to protect those workers as much as they are protecting us.”
His team reached out to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s staff to see where it could plug the most gaping holes. The answer was always the same: New York hospitals were desperate for PPE. So his team embarked on an odyssey to source face masks, disposable face shields, KN95 masks, gowns and microporous disposable coveralls from distributors all around the world. They will be distributed to Brookdale and Gov. Cuomo’s relief efforts.
From there, team Barrett drew up a play to maximize his donation power and ensure that every move was done with purpose.
“I just wanted to get people what they needed,” Barrett said. And it wasn’t a one-size-fits-all answer.
After reading stories that shoes aided the spread of coronavirus, the Puma athlete teamed up with the sneaker company to donate over 1,000 pairs of sneakers and slippers across Brookdale, Maimonides Hospital and Credit Valley Hospital in Canada so medical workers could leave their contaminated shoes at work and have fresh gear to wear home.
Barrett also looked north to his Canadian homeland, where the virus caused a very different crisis: depleting food bank supplies. He dropped $100,000 to the Mississauga food bank, which has nine locations throughout Ontario.
“I just spoke to them and they said the donation was going to be able to provide 200,000 meals and that put a smile on my face,” Barrett said.
Then he turned to his colleagues, the folks who keep the engine running at the World’s Most Famous Arena.
“I love playing at Madison Square Garden. I am cool with the security guards. Everyone that works at MSG, they take care of me so much,” Barrett said. “I thought about all they do for us. They are such amazing people.”
He gave $25,000 to MSG Relief Fund, which provides employees with financial assistance for a variety of areas including unanticipated healthcare costs, rent, food, medicine and other expenses.
After all of the checks cashed and the equipment shipped, Barrett’s assist was worth $250,000.
“If we can make their lives a little easier and help people survive, that’s what it’s all about,” he said
Meanwhile Barrett is trying to keep in shape and stave off boredom.

“I do regular kid stuff like play video games,” said Barrett who is going for runs and working out on equipment in his home. He is watching old games of hoops.
“I am watching old NBA playoffs, women’s college basketball, tons of basketball. And I can’t wait for the MJ documentary to come out,” he said of the highly anticipated 10-part documentary “The Last Dance” about Michael Jordan and the Bulls dynasty.
And he of course watched all the reactions on social media to his friend Sabrina Ionescu getting selected first overall in the WNBA draft on Friday night by the Liberty.
“I was hype for her. She will love New York,” Barrett said. “She is perfect for this city.”
Barrett says it will be cool to hit up restaurants and explore the Big Apple with Ionescu when everything comes back to life.
“What I really want to do is go to a game,” he said. “Maybe she can hook me up.”
As for his fellow Knicks, he is always in touch.
“I speak to my teammates and we try to check in. Especially with the New York staff. Everyone seems to be doing OK and trying to see how we can help. We all really miss playing basketball.”
This struggle has given Barrett a new perspective. “Life is short. This has taught me to be thankful. Be grateful for every single moment you spend with your family. I am blessed that we are safe and healthy and together.”"

President Trump played a clip of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo praising his administration during a briefing from the White House coronavirus task force on Sunday.
In the 2-minute clip from Cuomo’s own briefing on the virus earlier Sunday, the governor said that the federal government had “stepped up and was a great partner” to the Empire state.
“These were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilization,” Cuomo said, referring to the Navy-built hospital at the Javits Center and the USNS Comfort.
After the footage played, Trump said the clip had left out “the good part” — apparently more compliments from Cuomo.
“I just think it’s so good because it’s bipartisan,” the president said.
He then played another clip of Cuomo saying that none of the victims of the virus in New York have died due to a shortage of hospital space or ventilators. 
“I think it’s a tribute to New York, I think it’s a tribute to the federal government,” Trump said.
There was no mention in the clip of Cuomo calling on the federal government to come through with a cash infusion to help the state post-coronavirus.
“If you don’t help the state government and local government, then how are we supposed to have the finances to re-open?” asked the governor earlier on Sunday.
“If you starve state and local government, all that means is we have to turn around and reduce funding to the people who we are funding.”
Asked by a CNN reporter why he was taking time during the briefings to discuss praise he had received, Trump said he was “standing up for the men and women who have done such an incredible job,” not for himself.
“It’s not about me. Nothing is about me,” he said. “You are never going to treat me fairly, many of you, and I understand that.”"

DENVER — Thousands of people staged a peaceful protest outside Colorado’s Capitol on Sunday against the state’s stay-at-home order and its closures of thousands of nonessential businesses as ways to fight the spread of the coronavirus.
Denver’s protesters joined others in the West, including Utah, Idaho and Washington state, in staging rallies demanding immediate action to reopen states for business.
Horn-honking motorists lined up for several blocks on an avenue leading to the Capitol building, then circled it as pedestrians, some not wearing masks, congregated closely outside the building. Many waved American flags and held signs that read “End the Virus, Not the Economy” and “We need stability to stay healthy,” The Denver Post reported. Other signs expressed support for President Donald Trump, who has called for a rapid economic reopening, and against Gov. Jared Polis, whose orders shuttered thousands of nonessential businesses. Police officers wearing masks and gloves kept tabs on the protest.
Hand-washing and staying home if you’re sick are fine — but not closing businesses, said protester Jim Fenimore of Colorado Springs. “Every day that goes by is hurting the state.”
Hundreds of thousands of residents have filed unemployment claims since a statewide order shut nonessential businesses on March 26. Colorado’s unemployment rate rose from a historic low of 2.5% in February to 4.5% in March, the state reported Friday.
Polis’ office said the governor respects citizens’ right to protest but that “those participating are only endangering themselves.”
At least 411 people have died in Colorado and 9,433 have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the state health department.
Polis has laid out goals for an economic reopening that he says will include social distancing in work and social settings until a vaccine or cure is found for the coronavirus. He urged businesses to consider continued telecommuting where possible, staggered work shifts, barriers between work stations and other ways to contain the virus.
Like many governors, Polis also has stressed that more data is needed to determine how effective social distancing is in curbing the virus’ spread.
For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death."

The Red Sox great, whose left knee has ailed him since Manny Machado famously slid into it with his spikes in 2017, isn’t “at a point where he’s thinking to be ready to come back and join us,” interim manager Ron Roenicke recently told reporters.
The 36-year-old Pedroia has played in just nine games over the past two seasons due to his troublesome knee, and suffered another significant setback while rehabbing in January.
Pedroia didn’t participate in spring training and was said to be weighing his options, which likely included retirement, when baseball suspended operations on March 12 due to the pandemic.
The Red Sox haven’t had much luck at second base without Pedroia, leading them to sign Jose Peraza this offseason. The 25-year-old Peraza hit .239/.285/.346 in 141 games with the Cincinnati Reds last season.
Pedroia, the 2008 American League MVP, has won two World Series with the Sox, but was inactive for their 2018 title run.
He has made more than $103 million in 15 seasons with Boston, and is slated to earn $13 million annually through the 2022 season."
223,Spain coronavirus deaths climb by lowest daily amount in a month,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/spain-coronavirus-deaths-climb-by-lowest-daily-amount-in-a-month/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"MADRID – Spain’s death toll from the new coronavirus outbreak rose by 410 on Sunday, the lowest daily increase in about a month in one of the world’s hardest hit countries, prompting cautious optimism from the government that the figures are on a downward path.
The daily increase in deaths was the lowest since March 22. It is far below the highest daily increase – 950 deaths reported on April 2 – in a sign of a slowdown of the spread of the virus after Spain imposed a strict lockdown in mid-March.
The total number of deaths reached 20,453 on Sunday, the Health Ministry said. It is the third-highest toll worldwide after the United States and Italy.
The overall number of coronavirus cases rose to 195,944 from 191,726 on Saturday. Health workers account for 15.6% of those infected, health emergency chief Fernando Simon told a press briefing.
“Data confirms the breaking of the curve, even with an increased number of tests,” said health minister Salvador Illa, referring to the evolution of the death toll. “It is still a difficult stage, but we are going in the right direction”.
Spain is conducting around 40,000 coronavirus tests daily, one of the highest numbers among European countries, Illa said. Close to a million tests had been conducted as of April 13.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday he would ask parliament for a 15-day extension of the country’s lockdown until May 9, but said the restrictions would be more flexible.
Parliament will convene next Wednesday, Illa said.
The leftist-coalition government received widespread backing for the previous two extensions of a state of emergency first imposed on March 14, including from the main opposition conservative party PP.
“From the beginning we have said that (Sanchez) would have our support to save lives but not to ruin Spain or to hide his mistakes,” PP’s leader Pablo Casado said in an interview with La Razon newspaper published on Sunday.
The interview was conducted before Sanchez’s announcement on Saturday that he would seek another extension.
Sanchez is scheduled to meet Casado on Monday as the prime minister aims to launch what he has called “agreements for reconstruction”, a wide-ranging nationwide pact to address the aftermath of the virus’ impact."

Three people were arrested for violating the city’s social distancing restrictions outside an iconic Jewish synagogue in Brooklyn.
The arrests at the World Headquarters of Chabad-Lubavitch on Thursday came after police responded to calls about “New Yorkers NOT social distancing” outside the synagogue, NYPD Chief Terence Monahan said in a tweet.
“After numerous warnings from officers and continued disputes, three arrests were made,” Monahan wrote.
Arrested during the incident were Menachem Hilel, 29, who was charged with assault and criminal trespass, police said Sunday.
Two other men, Ariel Balon, 37, and Moshe Blumenfeld, 20, were each charged with resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration, police said.
Yaacov Behrman, a spokesman for Chabad-Lubavitch, said Sunday that the men were part of an unsanctioned group gathering outside the temple, which had been closed due to coronavirus restrictions. He said police had the synagogue’s blessing to break up the gathering outside the building.
“We made it clear that we support any action the police take to uphold the law,” Behrman said.
He said the group “had no permission to be there. Chabad made it clear no one has permission to be on the property.”
Police have begun cracking down on large gatherings that violate the city’s lockdown rules, including a raucous gathering at a Brooklyn barbershop on Saturday."

Some of America’s most beautiful spaces, our university campuses, are closed and empty these days. Schools have canceled their spring semesters and commencements because of COVID-19; classrooms, dormitories and athletic facilities are shuttered.
Some institutions tell students that they can continue to access instruction online. But exams and grades have been canceled in many cases. One suspects online viewership will be sporadic, concentration light.
But students shouldn’t hover around their home mailboxes waiting for an envelope with a tuition-rebate check. And students — and parents —who expect campuses to reopen this fall, next spring or the fall after that may be in for surprise and disappointment.
American higher education has been in serious and growing trouble in the past two decades. Yes, our science and technology departments lead the world, and the social-sciences and humanities departments still boast some brilliant scholars.
But at some point, too much of a good thing stops being a good thing. People have observed for years that college graduates make more money over their lifetime than non-college graduates. But it doesn’t follow that people not headed to college will make money if they go there.
A dismaying number of American college freshmen never end up graduating, not after four or six or 20 years. An even more dismaying number of nongraduates and graduates end up with daunting amounts of college debt, nondischargeable in bankruptcy, which reduces or prevents significant wealth accumulation. Americans today have more college debt than credit-card debt.
And for what? In his new book, “The Breakdown of Higher Education,” John Ellis, an emeritus professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, cites multiple studies showing that half of graduates make no intellectual gains. Many schools don’t teach the basics of US history or government. College degrees aren’t so much evidence of learning as of plodding persistence.
And a willingness to put up with left-wing agitprop. American universities keep grinding out more PhDs (writing theses no one may ever read) than they have tenure-track teaching jobs so that an increasing number accept hourly wages as adjuncts and look forward to increases in the minimum wage.
Meanwhile, administrators now outnumber teachers at many institutions. Many spend their time in meetings and conferences promoting “equity, inclusivity and diversity.” Some spend time enforcing speech codes prohibiting free expression that colleges and universities at one time fostered.
Others are occupied in regulating adult students’ social behavior, conducting kangaroo courts in which those accused of sexual harassment or assault are denied any presumption of innocence, the ability to call witnesses and knowledge of any charges.
The notion that adults, who are eligible to vote and serve in the military, need such guidance is rooted in the Latin phrase in loco parentis, the notion that students at residential colleges need something like parental supervision, even if that supervision is irksome and increasingly expensive.
The fact is that the residential college, the model of American higher education since its 17th-century foundations, is the exception rather than the rule in most of the world. University students typically live in parental homes or with roommates in cheap nearby apartments. That’s true of most undergraduates in Britain, where Cambridge and Oxford and their beautiful quads were the models for Harvard and William & Mary.
For the 100 or so selective colleges, the residential-college model will continue to be profitable. But even Harvard, with its $37 billion endowment, saw fit to lay off hundreds of subcontracted campus dining-hall workers.
Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of lesser-known schools, whose graduates never get interviews with Goldman Sachs, may be thrust into bankruptcy if the perceived need for social distancing closes classrooms or reduces enrollments.
As Heather Mac Donald writes in City Journal, “Students and their parents may start to ask why they should pay astronomical fees for a campus experience if they can get the same instruction over the Web.”
And perhaps some college and university administrators will ask whether they can somehow cut back on administrative bloat, especially if the alternative is figuring out some other use for beautiful but suddenly obsolete campuses."
226,Andrew Cuomo owes a genuine back-to-work plan to New Yorkers,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/andrew-cuomo-owes-a-genuine-back-to-work-plan-to-new-yorkers/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
With his announcement Thursday that New York would continue its “pause” until May 15, it became clear that Gov. Andrew Cuomo has lost control of the crisis — which he hitherto had such command over.
The problem, in a nutshell, is that the blanket policy divides businesses into “essential” and “nonessential.” The better frame is to divide businesses that can operate safely and those that can’t.
Cuomo’s totalizing approach, moreover, fails to distinguish between Manhattan (population: 1.6 mill­ion) and Morehouse, NY (population: 77).
Cuomo had been a calming force, bringing serene authority to an anxious moment, especially when compared to our erratic mayor and combative president. But now we need more than serenity and confidence. We need a roadmap back to normal. Cuomo has failed to produce any such thing.
Maybe he let the early good ­reviews go to his head. At the news conference where he announced another month of quarantine, Cuomo rambled about Joe Friday and “Dragnet,” which he raved was “an unappreciated cinematic treasure.” Spare us the Dad jokes and Boomer references, Governor. It isn’t appropriate. People are dying across the state; others are terrified of economic collapse and ­unemployment.
Cuomo’s official Web site touts the Thursday news conference as one in which the governor “outlined a blueprint to un-pause New York.” But where, exactly, is that blueprint?
The list on his site, presumably the “blueprint,” describes a “phased return” to a “new normal.” But when and how? When will that phased ­return begin if we have a month of the status quo with not even minimal adjustments or a more nuanced frame than essential/nonessential? It appears more like a blueprint to someday ­develop a blueprint.
It doesn’t help that the lockdown rules don’t quite apply equally to everyone. Cuomo’s brother, Chris, came down with COVID-19 and has been broadcasting his CNN show — featuring grossly obsequious coverage of the governor — from his house in Southampton.
Last week, Chris announced that his wife, Cristina, had also tested positive for the virus. Who knows how that happened? But it’s disconcerting enough that Chris has blatantly not been quarantining.
A few days before the announcement about his wife, Chris was seen in East Hampton, a 30-minute drive from his home, visiting a property of his that is under construction. He had a verbal altercation with a bicyclist who, correctly, asked what he was doing outside.
The governor was on Chris’ show Thursday and commiserated about Cristina’s diagnosis but said it was inevitable, since “it’s very hard for a person to quarantine in a home, and other people not to get it.” Perhaps the governor should clarify what it means to quarantine, as ­either most New Yorkers don’t ­understand what it means — or his own kid brother doesn’t.
Consistency matters. This would have been a great moment for the governor to show that we’re all in this together, that no one gets special treatment — and that his brother, who has been open that he still has symptoms including fever, shouldn’t be leaving his room, much less his house. The gov failed to do that, even as he extended a blanket lockdown on the rest of us.
“Everyone asks when it’s over,” the governor has said. “It’s over when you have a vaccine. And that’s 12 to 18 months away.”
If the governor is planning to keep us locked down for more than a year — with big exceptions made for his ­famous brother to visit his construction project when he feels like it — he needs to say so now.
If he isn’t, he needs to be specific about how and when we will be ­reopening. A good model to follow might be Europe’s phased reopening, starting with small businesses that can be patronized without compromising social distancing.
We are past the calming stage. Solidarity breaks down when there’s little hope or the appearance of favoritism (cough-cough, Chris!). Worse, authoritativeness loses its shine if a growing share of the population senses there is no real plan.

Medical businesses and trade associations across the state are asking Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature to pass new liability protections to fend off the ambulance chasers looking to cash in on the coronavirus crisis. It should be a no-brainer.
After all, health-care facilities and their suppliers are now going all out to save lives amid the pandemic — but the threat of lawsuits forces butt-covering actions that divert time and resources from their real work.
Of course true wrongdoers should still be held responsible, but (for example) pharmacies shouldn’t have to deal with lawsuits for not having enough hand sanitizer.
Nor should caregivers risk lawsuits over experimental medications that don’t work or all the other things that can go wrong without being anyone’s fault.
Sadly, New York’s tort lawyers are a ginormously wealthy and politically potent lobby, always ready with an argument as to why society supposedly benefits from their predations. They’re pushing a variety of bills that would actually increase liability and encourage frivolous suits.
For once, state lawmakers should ignore the legal lobby, and do the right thing."

Congress needs to heed MTA Chairman Pat Foye’s plea for another $4 billion in federal aid. The coronavirus crisis has crushed the mass-transit agency’s finances, with roughly $8 billion in toll, tax and fare revenues likely lost this year.
Since the pandemic hit, subway and bus ridership is down more than 90 percent, while bridge tolls have dropped 62 percent.
The MTA is crucial to the functioning of the nation’s most important city — and so will be vital to the nation’s post-coronavirus economic recovery.
Even as the WuFlu recedes, concerns about a second wave of outbreaks may leave commuters wary about returning to the subways and buses. MTA senior executive Janno Lieber hinted at such when he unveiled new financial projections last week, noting that key variables for ridership going forward include “how do people feel about using public transit again” amid concerns that the subways have been key to the disease’s spread.
Without a major influx of cash, the MTA will have to hike fares and cut service, as well as delay much of its $51.5 billion five-year modernization plan. It’s already facing new costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars for regular disinfection of its rolling stock.
Yes, the city and state should help bail out the agency, but they’re both facing their own plummeting revenues. And with the feds bailing out airlines as well as other private transportation companies, this vital public agency deserves equal treatment.
Foye is right to say that restoring the MTA is a “matter of national interest.” Congress’ duty is clear."

HBO’s Bill Maher has had it with the media’s tendency to portray the coronavirus pandemic — serious as it is — as an apocalyptic event. As Tim Hains recounts at RealClearPolitics, Maher begged reporters not to “hope-shame me,” especially “now that we’re starting to see some hope in all this.” Besides, Maher noted, constant panic and gloom is just bad politics: “It gives Trump the chance to play the optimist, and optimists tend to win American elections. FDR said, ‘The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.’ . . . I could see Trump riding that into a second term.”
Iconoclast: Let COVID Kill the Handshake
COVID-19 has changed America, and The Week’s Matthew Walther hopes one shift becomes permanent: “Handshakes are bad for reasons that have nothing to do with public health.” A handshake is “never comforting, like a hug.” And “regardless of who actually initiates it, there is a tacit understanding that one of the two people is in a subordinate, even a servile, position, which is why handshakes are required of people who lose sporting contests.” Worst is “Firm Handshake Guy”: “Your continued membership in civilization depends upon putting up with his nonsense” — “until we replace the handshake with an elegant Japanese-style bow.” Bowing would allow us to avoid spreading disease in any season and “make us a politer, gentler, more egalitarian society.” It’s “a natural extension of the nod, that humblest and most reassuring of everyday gestures.”
Science desk: Let COVID Kill Recycling
Pity the greens. First grocery stores banned reusable bags; now COVID-19 has struck another blow: “the shutdown of recycling programs in towns and cities across America,” City Journal’s John Tierney mock- mourns. “Consumers face some risk when they gather their items for curbside bins or take them to drop-off sites, but the biggest danger is to the workers who haul the stuff away or sort it by hand.” Localities have suspended programs in 30 states “because of budgetary concerns, the lack of a market for plastic recyclables, a shortage of protective gear, and other consequences of the pandemic, such as the decision by many prisons to limit the activities of inmates.” Recycling programs, which “are more expensive than sending trash to a landfill,” should shutter permanently. “There’s no need for consumers, workers, prisoners, or anyone else to sift by hand through that garbage — not now, and not after the pandemic is over, either.”
Libertarian: Whitmer’s Witless Leadership
If you want “a lesson on how not to deal with the coronavirus crisis,” just look at Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, sighs Reason’s Shikha Dalmia. Unlike the governors of next-door Indiana and Ohio, who are relaxing their stay-at-home orders, Whitmer ­recently issued an executive order that, among other things, prevented big-box stores from selling “home-improvement material not considered essential,” shut down “lawn-care services” and “forbade families from traveling to their vacation cottages.” Worse, she “decreed that violations will count as misdemeanors” that can result in fines or criminal charges. Her order has already prompted four lawsuits and a huge amount of pushback, which she should take seriously: If ­Michiganers see her as “too power-hungry,” she’ll “lose legitimacy” — and, instead of defeating the coronavirus, “spark civil unrest.”
Foreign desk: We Need an ‘Iran Consensus’
“More than four decades after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, we still lack a consensus about the nature of the regime in Tehran and how to deal with it,” Lawrence Haas notes at The Hill. In fact, “we lack agreement on even the most basic issues relating to Iran”: We know, for example, that the Tehran regime “is far more authoritarian than democratic,” yet many experts “have held out hope” that “the election of a supposedly moderate Iranian president” will improve relations. Also, Washington still can’t decide “whether it considers Iran a normal nation or an unrelenting revolutionary cause” — or how dangerous a nuclear Iran will be. This year’s winning presidential candidate should work on creating an “Iran consensus” — because it’s “long past time to build one.”

“First of all, the virus was spawned in China. Second of all, they hid the virus behind the shield of the World Health Organization. The third thing they did was basically hoard personal protective equipment and now they’re profiteering from it,” Navarro said.
US officials are reportedly investigating whether the virus escaped from a Chinese lab. The lab — the Wuhan Institute of Virology — has denied producing the virus.
“What we know is that the ground zero for this virus was within a few miles of that lab,” Navarro said.
“If you simply do an Occam’s razor approach that the simplest explanation is probably the most likely, I think it’s incumbent on China to prove that it wasn’t that lab.”
Navarro also blasted China for using its “influence” at the World Health Organization to “hide the virus from the world” in the early weeks of the outbreak.
“This was a time where that virus could have been contained in Wuhan,” he said. “Instead, 5 million Chinese people went out from Wuhan and propagated the virus around the world.”
Last week, President Trump announced that the US would suspend payments to WHO, saying the group had failed to report accurate information from China during the early stages of the pandemic.
And, during that time, China hoarded PPE that it had imported, Navarro said, adding that the alleged actions left “people in New York, Milan, and everywhere in between defenseless when it came time to have that PPE.”
US exports of surgical masks, ventilators and other protective gear to China skyrocketed in January and February, USA Today reported.
The Post reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was weighing legal action against China for allegedly trying to corner the market on PPE."
231,CARES Act encourages employees to stay home rather than return to work,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/cares-act-encourages-employees-to-stay-home-rather-than-return-to-work/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Beefed-up unemployment benefits that the US government is doling out in the coronavirus crisis are so generous, they’re encouraging many recipients to stay home from work, The Post has learned.
The emergency legislation, the CARES Act, which was passed last month, is aimed at helping businesses and workers hurt by coronavirus shutdowns, including through $600 checks to people who can’t work or who were laid off.
But the federal checks combined with pumped-up state unemployment benefits, which in New York can add up to as much as $1,104 a week, means some workers through unemployment are now getting as much as — if not more than — what they were earning before the pandemic.
In addition, CARES gives families earning less than $75,000 in 2019 a one-time check for $1,200 — in addition to $500 for each child under 17.
These stimulus benefits make it tough for employers to ask people to work through the crisis, and raise questions about whether government stimulus is hurting the small, cash-strapped businesses it’s supposed to help.
“It’s put us in a weird position, because we are asking [employees] to come back to work, but they’ve told us they don’t feel safe, or they have said, ‘Why should I be paid less than I’m getting at home?’ ” said Meagan Beatty, who has been trying to reopen her Scranton, Pa.-based business after shutting it several weeks ago.
Beatty’s Northeast Commercial Sharpening company, which provides knife- and equipment-sharpening services to hospitals, schools, restaurants and grocery stores, was notified on April 9 that it is now deemed an essential business, giving it an opportunity to rehire.
The problem: Her seven drivers, who have been receiving unemployment checks, don’t want to resume their routes, she told The Post. Her drivers earn between $750 and $850 a week compared to the $1,000 or so in unemployment checks they are now receiving.
“We are looking at whether we can raise their salaries, but our revenues have declined by 100 percent. And if we reopen, we will have 50 percent of the business we had,” Beatty said.
Matthew Tully, an owner of law firm Tully Rinckey, which has 11 offices, including in Manhattan, also said his company has suffered multiple defections in recent weeks due to the CARES stimulus.
Three employees providing support services to the firm — and earning salaries in the low $40,000 range — resigned within the past two weeks, Tully said. And one job candidate, who had been laid off from her previous job at a law firm, turned down his offer of $45,000, even though it amounted to a $3,000 bump-up, Tully said.
The job candidate, a mother of school-age children who had started the interview process in February, turned down the job last week to stay at home with her children for as long as possible, according to Tully.
The three other employees are single mothers who said they could not perform their job functions from home because they, too, have to look after their school-age children, he said.
“I understand their position,” Tully said of his employees, but at the same time notes that he finds himself “competing with the federal government to bring people back to work.”
Other companies have been able to keep their workers on the job through pay increases and other perks.
Nebraskaland, a large meat wholesaler based in the Bronx, raised the salaries of its drivers — which start off at roughly $1,000 a week — by $2 an hour four weeks ago, chief executive Richard Romanoff told The Post. Warehouse workers also got a $2-an-hour raise.
“When the different relief packages came out, I was so worried about losing our workers,” Romanoff said.
But the raises combined with free meat at the end of each week, as well as complimentary meals during their shifts since the start of the pandemic, have helped keep people on the payroll, he said.
What’s more, Romanoff and other office staff, including sales and bookkeeping employees, arrive daily to the Hunts Point facility in a show of solidarity in support of the drivers whose work brings them into contact with the public.
That’s helped staffers like Thomas Hidalgo, who has worked in Nebraskaland’s warehouse for nearly five years, feel good about the company during the pandemic, he said.
“We are scared, but every day we get plastic gloves, masks and Lysol,” Hidalgo said. “I feel pride about the work we’re doing. I work for my family, but I see we are feeding many other families.”
Stimulus checks are seen by economists as a stopgap measure, with the real test coming when the economy reopens.
“Government action that corrects one problem usually leads to another problem somewhere else. This comes up during every recession,” said Chris Rupkey chief economist at MUFG Bank. “At the moment it doesn’t matter that the federal government has given more to workers because everyone is at home.”
Federal benefits expire on July 31 and require Congress to extend them, while New York state benefits continue for 39 weeks from the date they start.
But that might be too late for Beatty’s knife- and equipment-sharpening business. Rivals are already standing at the ready to take her customers, she said. Hiring new drivers is also out of the question because of the training required, she said.
If Beatty is unable to lure her drivers back, the company will apply for a loan through the CARES program to cover expenses until it can reopen. If it doesn’t reopen, Beatty says, “We will have to pay back the loan.”"
232,Cuomo gives unsolicited parenting advice during coronavirus briefing,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/cuomo-gives-unsolicited-parenting-advice-during-coronavirus-briefing/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Guess who’s coming to self-quarantine.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo took a detour during his daily coronavirus update to regale New Yorkers with tales of meeting his daughter’s boyfriend and holding Sunday dinner in the time of a pandemic.
“I started my tomato sauce before I left,” Cuomo volunteered during a Manhasset, Long Island press briefing. “We’re going to go back, we’re going to sit at the table, have spaghetti and meatballs on Sunday.”
Among the guests at the governor’s table was daughter Mariah Kennedy Cuomo — who recently got out of quarantine and joined her dad at the briefing — plus her unidentified boyfriend, Cuomo said.
“Mariah brought her boyfriend,” dished Cuomo, as his 25-year-old daughter with ex-wife Kerry Kennedy sat just feet away.
“The boyfriend is very nice, and we like the boyfriend.”
Cuomo took the opportunity afforded by the daily press briefing to offer an unsolicited pearl of wisdom to fathers.
“The answer of what you think of the boyfriend is always, ‘I like the boyfriend.’ Always,” he said.
“Because there’s only two options: Either you like the boyfriend, in which case you say, ‘I like the boyfriend,’ or you don’t like the boyfriend. But you can never say you don’t like the boyfriend,” he said. “I learned this lesson the hard way.”
Parents who make that mistake will have more to worry about than the coronavirus, Cuomo said.
“Otherwise, it triggers NDS. NDS is Natural Defiance Syndrome,” he said. “It’s not documented, but it is a psychological condition where, if you say as a father, ‘I don’t like him,’ Natural Defiance Syndrome kicks in, and then they like the boyfriend more because he is opposed by the father.”
But Cuomo insisted that he wasn’t simply trying to ward off NDS.
“In this case, I actually like the boyfriend,” he said. “We’re gonna be at dinner with the boyfriend, and we’re gonna have our spaghetti and our meatballs.”
Or, at least, that’s what will be on the menu.
“They won’t eat the spaghetti and meatballs, because when I cook it, they just won’t eat it,” he said. “But they move it around the dish, and that’s all I can ask.”
It was unclear where the boyfriend was isolating during coronavirus.
Cuomo used the latest quirky peek into his private life to highlight one of the silver linings brought on by the deadly coronavirus — and to urge gratitude to front-line workers answering the call despite it.
“We’re going to recall to them how important that meal was on Sundays, to have the family together, to take the time, to sit and to talk and to reconnect,” he said. “Think of all the people, all the essential workers who had to go out there every day and work in the middle of this, who frankly would have much rather stayed home.
“They didn’t get to stay home, and they got sicker and they died, more than anyone else, because they were there honoring their responsibility to their job and to public service.”"

A Queens woman who previously received a heart transplant and survived breast cancer has now beaten the coronavirus.
Footage shows Oumou Barry being discharged Thursday to roaring applause from staffers at Manhattan’s Mount Sinai Hospital.
Mt. Sinai cardiologist Dr. Anu Lala said it was a “scary process but we are really overjoyed to be sending her home.”
“It was very scary for our whole team. She only received her heart in December 2019,” she said. “We are really grateful.”
“God willing, everything will be safe and sound,” Lala said in the footage.
Barry, who is a mother of two, waved to and thanked hospital staffers as she was wheeled out of the hospital.
“I’m so happy. I’m free. I’m free of cancer… Free [of] coronavirus,” Barry said. “I am going home today.”
She urged others to “keep strong and keep praying for coronavirus to go away.”
“We have to fight. If we fight, we are going to get through,” Barry said."

Italy could lose one-sixth of its beloved bars and restaurants to the coronavirus crisis — with a staggering 50,000 predicted to have to close for good, according to reports.
The startling economic toll is being projected by Fipe, an Italian lobbying group for bar and restaurants in Italy — the first European nation to be completely overwhelmed by the pandemic, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Despite socializing being so key to Italian culture, junior health minister Sandra Zampa told the BBC it was “impossible” to imagine bars and restaurants reopening “until the discovery of a vaccine.”
One bar owner, only identified as Chiara, told the BBC, “We can’t survive a five- or six-month closure.”
“We poured all our lives into this place. We don’t even have the time to cry or despair about our adventure being over,” she said.
“If you close bars, bistros, restaurants — then it’s not Italy anymore,” she insisted.
The whole of Europe, in fact, will find re-opening “very difficult,” economist Nicola Nobile told the Journal.
The toll includes some centuries-old businesses, such as Germany’s Werneck Brewery which is closing after being in continuous business since 1617.
The decision to finally close caused “many tears,” admitted brewery manager Christine Lang, whose family has owned the brewery since 1861. “My family and I will miss it very much. The brewery has been ever-present, part of every dinner table conversation all our lives,” she said.
“We will be missing part of our identity, and in a way the region will, too.”

235,Trump calls US the ‘King of Ventilators’ as governors plead for aid,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/trump-calls-us-the-king-of-ventilators-as-states-ask-for-aid/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"President Trump on Sunday declared that the US is the “King of Ventilators” and said he is “right on testing” the way he was “right” about the breathing devices.
“Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the ‘King of Ventilators’, other countries are calling asking for help-we will!), I am right on testing,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!”
The president, who has been criticized by some governors for not providing enough testing kits or ventilators for use in the treatment of coronavirus patients, had said at the White House briefing on Saturday that the country has enough ventilators and has conducted 4 million tests.
“But I still go back because the hardest thing of all, by far, by a factor of 20, is the ventilators. And now we’re the king of ventilators. We have ventilators,” he told reporters, adding that the US will use its supply to help other countries in need of ventilators.
He said he has spoken to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is in need of ventilators, and told him the US would help “very substantially.”
The president’s Sunday tweet came after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said it was “delusional” for Trump to suggest that states have sufficient testing kits to begin taking steps to open their states for business.
“That’s just delusional to be making statements like that,” Northam said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“We have been fighting every day for PPE. And we have got some supplies now coming in. We have been fighting for testing. It’s not a — it’s not a straightforward test. We don’t even have enough swabs, believe it or not. And we’re ramping that up. But for the national level say that we have what we need, and really to have no guidance to the state levels, is just irresponsible, because we’re not there yet,” he continued."
236,NYC transit workers want preferential shopping treatment like first responders,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/nyc-transit-workers-seek-preferential-shopping-given-front-line-duties/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"City transit employees say they deserve the same preferential treatment as cops and doctors when it comes to shopping — including being allowed to skip lines and avoid product limits, given their “front-line” work.
“As far as first-responders go, we’re taking them to work — and we’re not being afforded any form of courtesy or respect,” subway operator Adam Black, 47, told The Post on Sunday.
The Transport Workers Union Local 100, of which Black is a member, said it has had 42 workers die from COVID-19, or more than the number of city cops, firefighters and EMTs — combined.
“We are getting the essential workers to their jobs. Dozens of transit workers have died,” said union President Tony Utano. “[Transit workers] absolutely should be recognized for all that they are doing and have sacrificed.”
Black said he tried to avoid the line at the ShopRite at the Gateway Mall in East New York, Brooklyn, on Saturday, to no avail.
“I’m dying out here. … My brethren are dying. … We’re the ones taking the first responders where they gotta go,” Black told security guards at the grocery store’s entrance, according to video he posted to Facebook.
One of the guards responded to the train operator, who lives in Canarsie, Brooklyn, that while he recognizes Black is an “essential” worker, the privilege is only for “first responders.”
MTA bus driver Letty Daniels, 33, told The Post that she tried to get ahead of the line at a Food Bazaar in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, last week because she just wanted to buy a roll of paper towels, and at first was rebuffed.
“I said, ‘How did the cashiers get to work today? I’m sure they took mass transit,” she recalled.
Daniels of Brooklyn said a worker eventually let her in without waiting.
A store manager told The Post on Sunday, “Personally, speaking for myself, we try as much as possible” to help out transit workers by letting them bypass the lines.
Daniels said an employee at BJ’s Wholesale on the border of Queens also relented for her a few days later, even though it was technically against policy.
“The guy said they’re not supposed to, but he would let me in this one time,” Daniels said.
Still, she said that when she tried to buy an extra container of disinfectant wipes — one for her and one for work — she was denied. First-responders are not restricted by the one-per-customer rule, she said.
“We’re not saying we’re first-responders per se, but we are front-line workers. We’re on the front lines. The doctors can’t get to where they’re going, the nurses can’t get to where they’re going” without mass transit,” Daniels said.
“We’re basically risking our lives, and we’re not even getting the respect that’s due.”
City bus driver Jonathan Baldwin, 38 of Far Rockaway, Queens, said he has been canvassing individual stores to see what their policies are, in an effort to help colleagues figure out where they can go for better treatment.
He said he asked a manager at one Costco in Brooklyn if the store would consider allowing transit workers in during special times reserved for seniors. The manager said no, Baldwin recalled.
“Everybody says, ‘We appreciate you because we use you. But unfortunately, we can’t give you that courtesy,’ ” he said.
The MTA said it fully supports the push by the transit workers.
“New York City Transit’s work force are truly heroes of this crisis,” agency spokesman Shams Tarek said in a statement. “The MTA supports any effort to provide them with a priority access to benefits being afforded our region’s heroes.”
ShopRite, BJs and Costco did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment.

237,"California secures over 15,000 hotel rooms for homeless during pandemic: gov",https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/california-secures-over-15000-hotel-rooms-for-homeless-during-pandemic-gov/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"California has acquired over 15,000 hotel rooms to shelter homeless people during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday.
Newsom said a new agreement with the Motel 6 hotel chain will provide an additional 5,025 hotel rooms at 47 locations in 19 counties.
“Today marks an important milestone for our efforts to protect very vulnerable homeless individuals from COVID-19, and to protect our hospitals more broadly from surges that challenge our capacity and stress our system,” the governor said.
Newsom made the announcement outside a Motel 6 in San Jose, where he touted his “Project Roomkey” initiative introduced two weeks ago.
The federal government has agreed to pay 75 percent of costs associated with housing some people experiencing homelessness. The project covers people who test positive or may have been exposed to COVID-19, older homeless people and those with underlying health conditions.
Participating counties are responsible for identifying which individuals need a Project Roomkey placement, and then moving those individuals into the rooms.
While praising municipalities that have stepped in to find temporary housing for the homeless, Newsom said Saturday there were “equivalent number of cities” that are blocking efforts to help the homeless. He wouldn’t name them.
“Please consider the morality of those decisions. Consider the moment we’re in and the ethical question you’re being called and asked upon. Consider your station in life and in history,” the governor said. “All of us will be judged.”
Los Angeles County prosecutors requested an emergency hearing with a federal judge Friday, alleging the cities of Lawndale and Bell Gardens threatened to terminate city permits for hotels and motels participating in the program.
Laguna Hills in Orange County is also pushing back against plans to move homeless people into a hotel, the Orange County Register reported Thursday.
The city filed a lawsuit on Tuesday claiming the county’s plan “poses a direct threat to the health and safety of the surrounding community.”
An attorney representing the city and building owners said there was concern the facility could not be secured which could increase the threat of community spread of the virus.
“If they want to walk out onto the streets, they have the civil rights to do so, just like the rest of us,” Kelly Richardson told the paper.
A judge blocked the plan on Thursday, saying he wanted more information from the county and how the agreement for use of the hotel wasn’t a violation for the development where it was located, the Register reported. Another hearing is scheduled for Monday.
“I don’t have enough before me that tells me the government can automatically do this,” Judge Thomas Delaney said.
There have been concerns that COVID-19 could sweep through the state’s estimated 150,000 homeless people, many of whom have chronic health conditions and lack safe places to quarantine themselves. Homeless populations are particularly susceptible to COVID-19, which can be spread through coughing and sneezing.
In Los Angeles, where more than 30 homeless people have tested positive for coronavirus, medical teams will begin screening people for the virus on the streets, aided by fast-result field tests, Mayor Eric Garcetti said.
Those who are infected will be offered transportation to shelters and have hotel rooms set aside for them.
San Francisco is the only city statewide to report a large-scale outbreak at a homeless shelter, after more than 100 people tested positive, including 10 staff members. None of the people was seriously ill when tested, but three have since been hospitalized, public health spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said.
As of Saturday, Newsom said the state has “flattened the curve” of COVID-19 cases, but the region is not yet safe from the virus.
“We’ve certainly flattened the curve. The question is when are we going to see those numbers start to decline on a consistent basis as opposed to an episodic basis,” he said.
Hospitalizations increased 1.3 percent overnight, and the state recorded 87 deaths — one of the highest tolls since the crisis began.
In order to start lifting restrictions and allow businesses to reopen, Newsom has said the state needs to test 25,000 people a day and better track those who are infected, up to about 20,000 a day now. The governor pointed to a continued shortage of test swabs and the chemical agents needed to process the tests.
As of Sunday, there were 30,812 cases of COVID-19 in California with at least 1,148 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The Dallas-based luxury retail chain, which has been struggling financially for years, has been pushed to the brink by the coronavirus outbreak, sources said, and could become the first major US department store to fall victim to the perilous economic climate.
Neiman Marcus has hired Berkeley Research Group and Boston Consulting Group, sources said. BCG is charged with looking into three options: sell the business, shrink the chain by half the stores and keep operating, or a total liquidation.
A spokeswoman for BCG on Wednesday confirmed that BCG has been hired by Neiman Marcus, but added in a statement that “we have not been ‘charged with looking into’ the listed options,” and declined to elaborate.
The pandemic has forced the non-essential company to temporarily shut all 43 of its Neiman Marcus locations, roughly two dozen Last Call stores and its two Bergdorf Goodman stores in New York City.
Reuters first reported the news of the imminent filing, noting the company is in the final stages of negotiating a loan with its creditors totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, which would sustain some of its operations during bankruptcy proceedings, according to the sources.
Neiman Marcus’ borrowings total about $4.8 billion, according to credit ratings firm Standard & Poor’s. Some of this debt is the legacy of its $6 billion leveraged buyout in 2013 by its owners, private equity firm Ares Management Corp and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
It has also furloughed many of its roughly 14,000 employees — and skipped millions of dollars in debt payments last week, including one that only gave the company a few days to avoid a default, according to Reuters.
Other department store operators that have also had to close their stores are battling to avoid Neiman Marcus’ fate. Macy’s and Nordstrom Inc have been rushing to secure new financing, such as by borrowing against some of their real estate. JC Penney Co is contemplating a bankruptcy filing as a way to rework its unsustainable finances and save money on looming debt payments.

239,Dozens of NYC inmates back in jail after coronavirus release,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/dozens-of-nyc-inmates-back-in-jail-after-coronavirus-release/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Dozens of inmates freed from city jails over fears they were vulnerable to the coronavirus have wasted no time plaguing the city with new crimes, The Post has learned.
At least 50 of the 1,500 inmates cut loose amid fears of the spread of COVID-19 behind bars in recent weeks have already landed back in jail — and in some cases were set free yet again, according to police sources and records.
The re-offenders — just over 3 percent of those released — include a Rikers Island inmate initially jailed for allegedly setting his girlfriend’s door on fire and choking her mother, who was released early only to return to the Bronx apartment and allegedly threaten to kill the whole family.
Another prisoner who is accused of assaulting a Department of Homeless services officer and was later set free was arrested for punching an agency sergeant just two days after his release, records show.
Yet another, who was serving a 60-day sentence for theft, was charged with burglarizing Queens’ Singh Farm grocery store to the tune of more than $9,000 three weeks after his early release.
“Obviously, I’m not feeling good about it,” store owner Deepti Khurana said of the release. “You release him early and you leave him open to go and rob more people. No, I’m not completely satisfied with this thing. I’m not getting this.”
The Legal Aid Society and Bronx Defenders have been petitioning courts in the five boroughs since the outbreak of the coronavirus, arguing that inmates, particularly those who are older or have medical conditions, are more vulnerable to COVID-19 inside the confines of city jails.
On Wednesday, Legal Aid filed new petitions to release 20 more inmates, these from state prisons over the same coronavirus concerns.
“Our clients who are seriously ill or at a high risk if exposed to the virus should not face a death sentence on Rikers Island before a jury has even had a chance to judge their guilt or innocence, regardless of the charges against them,” Tina Luongo, the Legal Aid Society’s attorney in charge of criminal cases, said in a statement.
But the slew of early releases has irked some in the NYPD, who say the re-offenders are “targeting the most vulnerable victims” once they’re out.
“This is outrageous,” one police source said. “Our concern was that, you know, we really didn’t have much of a say at all. They did confer on some, but the majority of releases, we were never conferred with.”
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Wednesday he supported “compassionate release if we can do it safely,” and said he feared prisoners were taking advantage of the pandemic.
On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had set up a supervised release system to ease the impact of the newly released inmates.
“I’m concerned too anytime we release someone we have to make sure it’s as safe as possible,” the mayor said. “The fact is we’re going to keep doing whatever it takes to monitor these individuals.”
The majority of those sprung over the last few weeks were in on minor or non-violent crimes — but some 300 of them face violent felony charges.
Among the city’s worst repeat offenders is Darryl Naser, 25, who was rearrested five times in April alone after being released March 27, records show.
Naser, who police describe as a “transit recidivist,” was first jailed on charges of grand larceny and possession of stolen credit cards before his coronavirus-related release. He was arrested again April 1 on a burglary charge, and on April 4, April 6 and April 8 on drug possession charges.
He was released without bail each time, as he was after he was picked up yet again at the Herald Square subway station on Friday and charged with third-degree criminal possession of stolen property, court records show.
Police said he was caught stealing a purse.
Among the other inmates recently released and re-arrested is Victor Castillo, a 32-year-old Brooklyn man who has been arrested three times since being set free on March 24 — twice for criminal trespassing and once for allegedly breaking a bodega window to steal cash, police sources said.
He was released without bail Thursday and remains free, records show.
Charles Abbriano, a 53-year-old Staten Island man with a history of low-level crimes, was hit with a one-year sentence in January for several theft cases. He was released early on March 25.
The next week, Abbriano was pinched for petty larceny and released — only to be picked up again on April 9 for allegedly trying to steal a packed furniture truck with three other men in Dongan Hills, records show.
Pedro Hernandez, 45, of Brooklyn, had two violent felonies and five misdemeanor convictions on his record when police arrested him for allegedly stealing an electric bike from a basement on March 12. He was being held on $2,500 but was instead set free later that month over coronavirus concerns.
He was arrested again for allegedly burglarizing another apartment but was released again.
Daeshawn Sharperson, the 31-year-old Bronx man who admitted he torched his girlfriend’s door, pleaded guilty to criminal mischief, dodging felony charges, and got a four-month sentence. But his sentence was cut short when he was among about 100 inmates released early on March 26 over COVID-19 concerns.
Eight days later, police say, he returned to the apartment and allegedly threatened to kill the family before attacking a straphanger on two occasions. He is now being held on Rikers Island on $10,000 bail.
Wilmer Colindres, the man charged with attacking a DHS officer, was jailed on assault and harassment charges in November for the incident, court records show. While behind bars, he was hit with a new charge of forcible touching after allegedly grabbing a physician’s rear.
Nonetheless, Colindres, 39, was released on March 24, records show.
Two days later, he was charged with assaulting the sergeant and sent back to jail – only to be released again.
The 18-year-old charged with robbing Khurana’s store in Queens, Rainesh Abudin, was released early on March 20 on a “mercy petition for medical reasons” while serving a 60-day sentence and multiple pending burglary and grand larceny charges, records show.
On April 8, police said he broke in through the back door of Singh Farm and stole $9,281 from the store’s safe. He remains on the loose.

“Nervous Nancy is an inherently ‘dumb’ person. She wasted all of her time on the Impeachment Hoax. She will be overthrown, either by inside or out, just like her last time as ‘Speaker,'” the president tweeted on Sunday. “Wallace &@FoxNews are on a bad path, watch!”
He linked to a tweet from the Republican Party that accused Pelosi of playing politics by holding up refunding a loan program for small businesses, while noting her appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”
“When the #PaycheckProtectionProgram ran out of funding, she decided playing politics was more important than saving #SmallBiz. It is time for the Democrats to be held accountable for putting millions in financial limbo,” the GOP tweet said.
Pelosi, in her first interview on “Fox News Sunday” since 2017, said she would give Trump an “F” for his “weak” leadership during the pandemic.
“Leaders — leaders take responsibility. So I said he’s a weak leader. He doesn’t take responsibility. He places blame — blame on others,” Pelosi told host Chris Wallace.
“And that might have been OK before, but we cannot continue down a path that is, again I’ll come back to science, science, science, evidence, data on how we should go forward.”
Pelosi, who launched the impeachment inquiry into Trump in September 2019, told Wallace that she believes Congress will “come to an agreement” on refunding the small business loan program that went broke last week.
Pelosi lost the speakership in 2011 when Republicans won a majority in the 2010 elections."
241,"NYC coronavirus cases reach nearly 130,000, death toll at 8,811",https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/nyc-coronavirus-cases-reach-nearly-130000-death-toll-at-8811/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Nearly 130,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus have now been documented in the five boroughs of New York, city statistics revealed on Sunday.
An additional 3,420 diagnoses were made between 2 p.m. Saturday and 1:30 p.m. Sunday, raising the total number to 129,788 — up from 126,368.
The tally of confirmed coronavirus fatalities, meanwhile, rose to 8,811, while the number of “probable” deaths attributed to the disease hit 4,429, with respective increases of 363 and 165.
Combined, the two figures now stand at a staggering 13,240 New Yorkers.
The total number of patients in the five boroughs who have been hospitalized at some point is now approximately 34,602, according to City Hall.
The Big Apple stats suggest a trend similar to that revealed by state figures released earlier Sunday, as Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that New York is “past the high point” — but risks a relapse without diligence."
242,NYC schools could face 50 percent budget cut without federal aid: Cuomo,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/nyc-schools-could-face-50-percent-cut-without-coronavirus-aid-cuomo/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Empire State schools could be staring down a nearly 50-percent cut in funding unless the federal government helps prop up New York’s coronavirus-hobbled economy, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.
“If you don’t help the state government and local government, then how are we supposed to have the finances to re-open?” Cuomo rhetorically asked of the feds during a Long Island press briefing.
“If you starve state and local government, all that means is we have to turn around and reduce funding to the people who we are funding,” the governor continued.
“If we don’t get federal assistance, you’re looking at education cuts of close to 50-percent in the state of New York, where school districts would only get half of the aid they got from the state last year.”
The dire projection came hours after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio openly beseeched President Trump to open the federal coffers, ramping up an increasingly-common call from Hizzoner.
The Big Apple has already made $6 billion in cuts from its next proposed budget, and a report predicted last week that the city could lose out on nearly $10 billion in tax revenue alone by mid-2021.
Statewide cuts wouldn’t stop at schools, Cuomo warned Sunday.
“You’re talking about cut to hospitals from the state,” he said. “I mean, how ludicrous would it be for the state to now cut funding from state governments?”
The prospect, Cuomo said, has led a bipartisan group of governors to request of Beltway lawmakers a $500 billion aid package for state governments.
Without financial help, any efforts to re-ignite state economies may be over before they begin, Cuomo said.
“Everyone is saying, well, it’s up to the states to come up with a re-opening plan,” he said. “But the governors and the states have to have resources.”"

Researchers at the University of Aix-Marseille in France were unable to nuke the virus by placing infected African green monkey kidney cells in a 140-degree Fahrenheit room, according to a study on the pre-print server bioRxiv that has not been peer-reviewed.
The researchers say they tested the impact of heat on the virus in both “clean” laboratory conditions and “dirty” environments.
Both settings saw the virus replicate even when exposed for an hour at the 140-degree temperature, researchers said.
To kill the virus, it took 15 minutes of exposure to 197.6-degree temperatures, the report said.
Researchers, however, noted that most patients have lower viral loads than were tested in the vials, suggesting that lower heat levels could potentially be effective after all to kill the virus.
And preliminary results from a government lab experiment support the theory that warmer weather could slow the spread of the virus, according to a report.
Department of Homeland Security briefing notes that were leaked to Yahoo News, suggested that the virus doesn’t survive long in sunlight, humidity and warmer temperatures.
“Sunlight destroys the virus quickly,” the document said, according to Yahoo News.
The report, however, cautioned that the findings don’t indicate that summer weather will eliminate, or even decrease, new cases of the virus.
The DHS declined to confirm the findings in the leaked documents, the outlet reported.
“As policy, the department does not comment on allegedly leaked documents,” the DHS said in a statement.
“It would be irresponsible to speculate, draw conclusions, or to inadvertently try to influence the public based upon a document that has not yet been peer-reviewed or subjected to the rigorous scientific validation approach.”"

The defiant partiers began filing in the eNVee Barbershop in Canarsie around 6 p.m. Saturday for a rap music video shoot that quickly turned into a party, as music blasted from the single-story shop on Avenue L, residents told The Post.
The NYPD issued 68 summonses and arrested two of the attendees for gun possession, police from the NYPD’s 69th Precinct wrote on Twitter above a photograph of the alleged weapon.
Under the coronavirus lockdown, residents must remain six feet apart while in public and gatherings of any size have been banned outright. Offenders face fines up to $1,000.
In response to the illicit shindig, Mayor de Blasio said Sunday cops would keep breaking them up.
“I’m going to keep breaking those things up,” de Blasio said at a news conference.
“If people need summonses to get the message, we’ll do it,” he said. “And remember also, in terms of the guns that they picked up, policing goes on. The fight always to protect public safety goes on.”
Reports of speakeasy restaurants and underground carousing have circulated as government officials try to keep people separated to quell the spread of the deadly virus."
245,Coronavirus tests must be done ‘community by community’ before easing lockdown: Birx,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/coronavirus-tests-must-be-done-community-by-community-birx/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, said testing needs to get down to a “community by community” level to determine whether it’s safe to begin easing lock-downs and reopen businesses.
“What we’re trying to do is look at this in a very data-driven, granular scientific methodologies to predict community by community the testing that is needed,” Birx said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
“At the same time, working with every laboratory director across the country that have these multiple platforms to really understand and find solutions for them on their issues related to supplies.”
“It needs to be down to the communities, so the communities can see what happens in their communities and make decisions with the local and health officials and the state officials, what can be opened and what needs to remain closed,” she continued.
The Trump administration last week announced guidelines for governors to determine when they can begin reopening their economies — with phase one coming after the number of coronavirus cases has declined for 14 days.
Noting that the US is experiencing a “series of small epidemics” in some areas, Birx acknowledged that each community “will have a different testing need.”
“Testing needs to be focused critically where you start to see early evidence, because no test is 100 percent specific and 100 percent sensitive,” Birx said.
“If you test and over test in areas where there isn’t virus, you can end up with false positives and false negatives. Each of these epidemics will have a different testing need and that’s what we’re calculating now.”"

The worst of the coronavirus’ tear through the Empire State appears to have passed, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday — but there’s one big ‘if,’ he stressed, as another 507 New Yorkers have died.
The total number of hospitalizations continued its steady decline in the 24-hour period ending at midnight Sunday, sitting at 16,213, as opposed to 16,967 the day before.
“If the data holds, and if this trend holds, we are past the high point,” said Cuomo during a press briefing at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, LI.
“The recent news is good, that we are on the other side of the plateau and the numbers are coming down,” he said. “But that’s good news only compared to the terrible news that we were living with, which is that constant increase.”
Even as the total number of hospitalizations continued to dip downward, another 1,384 patients were admitted to hospitals on Saturday, and another 507 New Yorkers died, bringing the statewide toll to 13,869.
“Don’t get cocky,” he said. “Don’t get arrogant. This virus has been ahead of us every step of the way. This is only halftime in this entire situation.”"
247,Pence defends Trump’s call to ‘liberate’ states from coronavirus lockdown,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/pence-defends-trumps-call-to-liberate-states-from-lockdown/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday defended President Trump’s calls to “liberate” states under stay-at-home orders amid protests against the measures, saying the president wanted to encourage governors to “safely reopen” their economies.
“The American people know that no one in America wants to reopen this country more than President Donald Trump,” Pence said on “Fox News Sunday.”
“I can assure you he’s going to continue to encourage governors to find ways to safely and responsibly let Americans go back to work.”
The vice president said Trump’s wishes are in line with those of most Americans, who are impatient for the economy to restart so people can get back to work.
“What you see, I think, among millions of Americans who have been embracing those social distancing measures and making the sacrifices is they want their governors to find a way to responsibly and safely reopen their state economies,” he continued.
The president in a series of tweets Friday wrote: “LIBERATE MINNESOTA,” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” and then, “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”
Trump continued to speak out in support of the protests again at a White House briefing Saturday, claiming some states were being “unreasonable” with the lockdown guidelines and that “some of the governors have gotten carried away.”
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam on Sunday urged the president not to “focus on protests” as the country is battling the pandemic that has infected more than 735,000 Americans and killed more than 39,000.
“Our president has been unable to deliver on tests, now he has chosen to focus on protests, and this is not the time for protests,” Northam, a Democrat, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“This is not the time for divisiveness. This is time for leadership that will stand up and provide empathy, that will understand what’s going on in this country of ours with this pandemic, it’s the time of truth, and it’s time to bring people together.”
Meanwhile, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that she had to take “aggressive” measures because her state had the third-highest rate of coronavirus deaths in the nation.
“It is disproportionately hurting our state and that is why we need to take a uniquely aggressive action to protect people,” the Democrat said on CNN, adding that they’re working.
“We are seeing the curve start to flatten. And that means we’re saving lives,” she said.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said encouraging protests against stay-at-home orders contradicts the administration’s guidelines for states to begin opening businesses when they see a 14-day decline in cases.
“I don’t think it’s helpful to encourage demonstrations, and encourage people to go against the president’s own policy,” Hogan said on CNN.
He said his state — like some others targeted by Trump — has not seen a decline in coronavirus infections.
“So then to encourage people to go protest the plans that you just made recommendations on, on Thursday it just doesn’t make any sense. We’re sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations,” Hogan said.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was “unfortunate” protesters were rallying against the guidelines intended to keep people safe.
“Testing. Tracing. Treatment. Shelter in place. And I do think that it’s unfortunate,” Pelosi said on “Fox News Sunday.” “But, you know, people will do what they do. But the fact is, we’re all impatient. We all want out. But what they’re doing is really unfortunate.”
Pence, during his appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” was also questioned by host Chris Wallace about health experts’ claims that the capacity of daily testing has to increase to 500,000 before restrictions can be lifted.
“We believe the testing we have today across the country, once we activate all the labs that can do coronavirus testing, is sufficient for any state in America to move into phase one” of the White House’s reopening guidelines, the vice president said.
“We’re going to continue to fully partner with governors around the country and health officials in increasing and scaling the amount of testing, and we have every confidence that we can have a sufficient amount of testing to be able to reopen America,” he added."
248,Coronavirus lockdowns are crippling the global drug trade,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/coronavirus-lockdowns-are-crippling-the-global-drug-trade/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"NEW YORK — Coronavirus is dealing a gut punch to the illegal drug trade, paralyzing economies, closing borders and severing supply chains in China that traffickers rely on for the chemicals to make such profitable drugs as methamphetamine and fentanyl.
One of the main suppliers that shut down is in Wuhan, the epicenter of the global outbreak.
Associated Press interviews with nearly two dozen law enforcement officials and trafficking experts found Mexican and Colombian cartels are still plying their trade as evidenced by recent drug seizures but the lockdowns that have turned cities into ghost towns are disrupting everything from production to transport to sales.
Along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border through which the vast majority of illegal drugs cross, the normally bustling vehicle traffic that smugglers use for cover has slowed to a trickle. Bars, nightclubs and motels across the country that are ordinarily fertile marketplaces for drug dealers have shuttered. And prices for drugs in short supply have soared to gouging levels.
“They are facing a supply problem and a demand problem,” said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former official with CISEN, the Mexican intelligence agency. “Once you get them to the market, who are you going to sell to?”
Virtually every illicit drug has been impacted, with supply chain disruptions at both the wholesale and retail level. Traffickers are stockpiling narcotics and cash along the border, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration even reports a decrease in money laundering and online drug sales on the so-called dark web.
“The godfathers of the cartels are scrambling,” said Phil Jordan, a former director of the DEA’s El Paso Intelligence Center.
Cocaine prices are up 20 percent or more in some cities. Heroin has become harder to find in Denver and Chicago, while supplies of fentanyl are falling in Houston and Philadelphia. In Los Angeles, the price of methamphetamine has more than doubled in recent weeks to $1,800 per pound.
“You have shortages but also some greedy bastards who see an opportunity to make more money,” said Jack Riley, the former deputy administrator of the DEA. “The bad guys frequently use situations that affect the national conscience to raise prices.”
Synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and fentanyl have been among the most affected, in large part because they rely on precursor chemicals that Mexican cartels import from China, cook into drugs on an industrial scale and then ship to the U.S.
“This is something we would use as a lesson learned for us,” the head of the DEA, Uttam Dhillon, told AP. “If the disruption is that significant, we need to continue to work with our global partners to ensure that, once we come out of the pandemic, those precursor chemicals are not available to these drug-trafficking organizations.”
Cartels are increasingly shifting away from drugs that require planting and growing seasons, like heroin and marijuana, in favor of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which can be cooked 24/7 throughout the year, are up to 50 times more powerful than heroin and produce a greater profit margin.
Though some clandestine labs that make fentanyl from scratch have popped up sporadically in Mexico, cartels are still very much reliant upon Chinese companies to get the precursor drugs.
Huge amounts of these mail-order components can be traced to a single, state-subsidized company in Wuhan that shut down after the outbreak earlier this year, said Louise Shelley, director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, which monitors Chinese websites selling fentanyl.
“The quarantine of Wuhan and all the chaos there definitely affected the fentanyl trade, particularly between China and Mexico,” said Ben Westhoff, author of “Fentanyl, Inc.”
“The main reason China has been the main supplier is the main reason China is the supplier of everything — it does it so cheaply,” Westhoff said. “There was really no cost incentive for the cartels to develop this themselves.”
But costs have been rising and, as in many legitimate industries, the coronavirus is bringing about changes.
Advertised prices across China for precursors of fentanyl, methamphetamine and cutting agents have risen between 25% and 400% since late February, said Logan Pauley, an analyst at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington-based security research nonprofit. So even as drug precursor plants in China are slowly reopening after the worst of the coronavirus crisis there, some cartels have been taking steps to decrease their reliance on overseas suppliers by enlisting scientists to make their own precursor chemicals.
“Because of the coronavirus they’re starting to do it in house,” added Westhoff.
Some Chinese companies that once pushed precursors are now advertising drugs like hydroxychloroquine, which President Donald Trump has promoted as potential treatment for COVID-19, as well as personal protective gear such as face masks and hand sanitizers.
Meanwhile, the gummed up situation on the U.S.-Mexico border resembles a stalled chess match where nobody, especially the traffickers, wants to make a wrong move, said Kyle Williamson, special agent in charge of the DEA’s El Paso field division.
“They’re in a pause right now,” Williamson said. “They don’t want to get sloppy and take a lot of risks.”
Some Mexican drug cartels are even holding back existing methamphetamine supplies to manipulate the market, recognizing that “no good crisis should be wasted,” said Joseph Brown, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Texas.
“Some cartels have given direct orders to members of their organization that anyone caught selling methamphetamine during this time will be killed,” said Brown, whose sprawling jurisdiction stretches from the suburbs of Dallas to Beaumont.
To be sure, narcotics are still making their way into the U.S., as evidenced by a bust last month in which nearly $30 million worth of street drugs were seized in a new smuggling tunnel connecting a warehouse in Tijuana to southern San Diego. Shelley said that bust was notable in that only about 2 pounds of fentanyl was recovered, “much lower than usual shipments.”
Trump announced earlier this month that Navy ships were being moved toward Venezuela as part of a bid to beef up counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean following a U.S. drug indictment against Nicolás Maduro.
But the pandemic also has limited law enforcement’s effectiveness, as departments cope with drug investigators working remotely, falling ill and navigating a new landscape in which their own activities have become more conspicuous. In Los Angeles County, half of the narcotics detectives have been put on patrol duty, potentially imperiling long-term investigations.
Nonetheless, Capt. Chris Sandoval, who oversees special investigations for the Houston-based Harris County Sheriff’s Office, said there’s a new saying among his detectives: “Not even the dope dealers can hide from the coronavirus.”"
249,Heroes of the Day: 911 operators give lifeline to desperate New Yorkers,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/911-operators-give-lifeline-for-desperate-new-yorkers/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Their co-workers are sick. Their family members are falling ill. But as emergency calls reach unprecedented highs amid the coronavirus crisis, these 911 operators are working seven days a week to help make sure someone will always be on the other end of the phone. 
“Our city needs us,” Police Communications Technician Carla Jones told The Post. “We’re going to do whatever we can do so we can to help our city.” 
Jones, along with PCT Sophia McQuay and supervising PCT Laura Corlette, are picking up extra shifts at two dispatch centers in The Bronx and Brooklyn to handle the surge of skyrocketing emergency calls that have sometimes reached four times their usual level. Their workload stress is only compounded by the fact that a slew of colleagues have called out sick. 
“These three individuals have put the safety of New Yorkers above their own safety. They’re at their best when times are at the worst,” said Deputy Chief Richard Napolitano from the NYPD’s Communications Division. 
“They’ve been working long hours, double shifts, foregoing their days off, sacrificing time with their families. And they’re just giving 100 percent of themselves to make sure that a lifeline is always there to send help when needed.” 
When worried New Yorkers call in, saying they’re having difficulty breathing or need someone to check on a loved one, the technicians are there to keep them calm and assure them help is on the way. 
“The person will say, ‘I’m scared’ or, you know, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do, I don’t want to die’ and I have to assure them that …  ‘I’m here with you. If I need to stay on the phone with you, I’m going to stay on the phone with you,’ ” Jones said. 
“The other night, I was doing overtime, and I received a call from a young lady saying that she was having difficulty breathing, she tested positive. And her daughter is also in the house with her,” McQuay said. 
The young mom was so scared, McQuay couldn’t even get her to say her location, the first thing dispatchers need so they can send help. 
“She just kept on telling me that she couldn’t breathe. I kept on assuring her everything’s going to be alright, ‘Just take a deep breath, and let me get your address.’ … I had to comfort her before I could even pass this call on,” McQuay said. 
By the end of the call, the woman was thanking McQuay, who already had help on the way. 
Corlette, who’s been with the department for 21 years, worked through Sept. 11 but said the coronavirus is just “different” because of the call volume. Aside from surging cardiac-arrest and difficulty-breathing reports, the operators are also receiving a slew of wellness-check calls. 
“It’s so sad because some people are like, ‘My mom is elderly, I cannot go and check on her’ because, you know, they tested positive for COVID and we have to send the police to check on them,” Corlette said. 
She said it’s been “very hard” for her after she learned her own nephew tested positive for the virus. 
“I’m concerned about him. [But] I still have to come to work and handle the job,” the veteran operator said. 
Like all essential workers, the three techs take a risk every day when they come to work, but they’re willing to do it because all emergencies start with a 911 operator picking up the phone. 
“It’s mentally stressful and physically, but I know as an essential worker, I’m needed here to help out my fellow co-workers, my city that I live in,” McQuay said. 
Jones added, “If it’s not for us, who’s going to help them?
“I’m going to let them know that I’m here for them. We could be the last person they hear. So I want them to know that the last person they heard from, they cared.” "

Mayor Bill de Blasio cast a skeptical eye Sunday on calls for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to suspend service in New York’s subway system to stem the spread of the coronavirus, citing a need for essential workers to get around.
“The biggest challenge that would create would be for our front-line healthcare workers, first responders, essential workers,” de Blasio said during a press briefing. “We can’t have those people in a position where they can’t get to work.”
Hizzoner was responding to a letter sent by four City Council members to Cuomo, calling for the governor to pull the plug on subway service.
The quartet argued that the move would protect both riders and MTA workers, of whom dozens have died and thousands fallen ill with the contagion.
An MTA spokesman on Saturday called the proposal “a dangerous and a terrible idea,” stressing the role the rails serve in helping front-line workers get around — logic echoed by de Blasio on Sunday.
“I have trouble understanding any proposal unless we can prove that there’s another way for people to get around that actually works, the people we need the most,” said de Blasio. “If they can’t get to where we need them, that poses a threat to everyone.”
Instead, Hizzoner said that the key is stricter enforcement of existing precautions.
“We need tight social-distancing standards, and I think the MTA needs to do a better job of defining really clearly what’s the maximum number of people that should be on a subway car, and ensuring with the NYPD there’s never more than that number,” he said.
Cuomo’s office rejected the idea of shutting subways."
252,Testicles may make men more vulnerable to coronavirus: study,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/testicles-may-make-men-more-vulnerable-to-coronavirus-study/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The coronavirus could linger in the testicles, making men prone to longer, more severe cases of the illness, according to a new study.
Researchers tracked the recovery of 68 patients in Mumbai, India, to study the gender disparity of the virus, which has taken a worse toll on men, according to a preliminary report posted on MedRxix, which hosts unpublished medical research papers that have not been peer reviewed.
Dr. Aditi Shastri, an oncologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, and her mother, Dr. Jayanthi Shastri, a microbiologist at the Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Mumbai, said the virus attaches itself to a protein that occurs in high levels in the testicles.
This protein, known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2, or ACE2, is present in the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract and the heart in addition to large quantities in the testicles.
But since testicles are walled off from the immune system, the virus could harbor there for longer periods than the rest of the body, according to the study.
The mother-daughter researchers said these findings may explain why women bounce back from the virus more quickly than men.
They determined that the average amount of time for female patients to be cleared of the virus was four days, while men saw recoveries that on average were two days longer, the report said.
“These observations demonstrate that male subjects have delayed viral clearance,” the authors wrote, adding that the testicles may be serving as “reservoirs” for the virus.
The study may offer an explanation for reports out of Italy, South Korea and New York City that men are dying at higher rates from the virus.
Others have suggested that men are more vulnerable because they are more likely to smoke, have high blood pressure or suffer coronary artery disease."
253,De Blasio: Ratting out neighbors for social distancing isn’t ‘snitching’,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/de-blasio-reporting-social-distancing-flouters-is-saving-lives/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on his controversial push to get New Yorkers to rat on their neighbors who are not social distancing — insisting it was needed in “wartime” with an invisible enemy.
“In war times, in a time when people’s lives are threatened … I’m sorry, this is not snitching, this is saving lives,” Hizzoner said of his “New Squeal” push for New Yorkers to snap photos of those gathering in public.
“You’ve got to do it,” he said, insisting it was the only way of “protecting your own family” and fellow Gothamites.
“When we were threatened with terrorism, no one doubted that it was right if you saw something to call it in immediately,” he said of suspicious behavior.
“This is just the same reality, we just have a different enemy — an enemy you can’t see, but an enemy that has taken so many lives,” he said.
“We need those photos. We need those locations so we can enforce right away.”
The mayor conceded that staying inside was only going to get harder with the arrival of gorgeous Springtime temperatures — but threatened to dole out $1,000 fines for those he failed to heed social distancing guidelines.
“If you don’t understand it yet, we’re gonna have to get tougher and tougher,” he said.
As of Sunday, the city had issued a total 244 summonses and fines of up to $1,000 thanks to “proactive enforcement efforts” — not including extra ones from the NYPD in response to 311 or 911 calls, a City Hall spokesperson told The Post.
On Saturday alone, the NYPD said it issued 60 summonses and made two arrests during patrols on restaurants, bars and supermarkets to ensure social distancing was being maintained, the force said.
De Blasio noted that the fines were a hefty blow for many in the middle of an economic crisis.
“I agree. That’s why we don’t want to give fines,” he said, saying the easiest way to avoid one is to “just listen to the warnings.”
“But the first thing we have to do is save lives. The first thing we have to do is protect each other,” he said. “People have been warned and warned and warned … please, everyone, take it seriously.”
Hizzoner also stressed that arrests would be made as a “very last resort.”
“The folks who still don’t get it are gonna have to pay a price,” he said."

Mnuchin was asked during an interview on CNN whether putting the president’s name on the checks was Trump’s suggestion.
“That was my idea. He is the president and I think it’s a terrific symbol to the American public,” he said on “State of the Union.”
The stimulus payments of $1,200 for eligible individuals have been made through direct deposit, but the checks have yet to be issued.
“The reason why the checks have not gone out is we’re hoping that more people, as I said, will go to irs.gov.
It’s much safer to send out direct deposits,” Mnuchin said.

“As it relates to the president’s name on it, the president could have been authorized to sign the checks but that would have slowed things down. We didn’t want to do that,” he added.
The Treasury Department last week ordered Trump’s name be printed on the checks being sent out to millions of Americans.
His name will appear on the memo line below a line that reads this is an “Economic Impact Payment.”"

“I need a former New Yorker to step up — President Donald Trump,” Hizzoner said at a press briefing.
He called it a moment Trump “could actually help to save your hometown, or you can turn away and you can fail to protect New Yorkers.”
“And right now, you are failing to protect the very people who you grew up around,” de Blasio said in his tirade, saying the Big Apple gave Trump all the opportunities that made him so successful.
“When New York City’s in need, where are you?” he asked.
Accusing Republicans of failing to approve a stimulus deal, Hizzoner said, “Literally with a snap of his fingers Donald Trump could fix that. If he would just say the word, the Senate would jump.”
“So President Trump, what’s going on? Cat got your tongue?” he asked.
“Mr. Trump, Mr. President, Are you gonna save New York City, or are you telling New York City to drop dead? You have to speak up now,” he said."
256,Former City Councilman Noach Dear dies of coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/brooklyn-supreme-court-justice-noach-dear-dies-of-coronavirus/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Noach Dear has died following a battle with coronavirus, his family said Sunday.
The 66-year-old former City Councilman succumbed to COVID-19 early Sunday, his son-in-law Aron Hirtz told The Post.
Dear served on the New York City Council 1983-2001, representing Midwood and parts of Borough Park and Bensonhurst, before he was elected to the Brooklyn Supreme Court in 2015.
Former Brooklyn state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who served in the same Borough Park neighborhood when Dear was a councilman and judge, said Sunday that the justice will be “sorely missed.”
“This is such sad news,” Hikind said in a statement. “Noach was a champion, a friend and fighter for his people and all of his constituents. He especially cared for the voiceless and powerless, and dedicated his every single day to making the world a better place.”
Councilman Kalman Yeger, who now represents Dear’s former district, said the death was “impossible to digest.”
“Compassionate, funny, pragmatic, always patient & loved people,” he wrote on Twitter. “His lifelong public service touched many thousands.”
Gerard Kassar, who is chairman of the New York State Conservative Party, also paid tribute to the justice.
“Sorry to hear that Judge and former City Councilman Noach Dear has passed from this awful virus,” Kassar wrote on Twitter. “Knew him for literally decades. May He Rest In Peace. Prayers for him and his family.”
Dear made headlines when he was removed in 2018 from the Brooklyn Civil Court, where despite being on the state Supreme Court, he had been moonlighting two times a week on debt cases.
The Post found that Dear typically sided with those who had failed to pay their credit-card bills and other debts, particularly members of his own Orthodox Jewish community.
Journalist Tom Robbins noted the justice’s sometimes-controversial career when remembering him Sunday on Twitter.
“RIP Noach Dear, the rascally Boro Park politician-turned-judge who beat all the odds except this one,” he wrote. “No matter how many tough stories we tossed his way over the years, he enjoyed the joust and kept his sense of humor.”"

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he is “hopeful” that Congress will strike a deal Sunday on replenishing the small business loan program that ran out of cash last week.
“I’m hopeful that we can reach an agreement that the Senate can pass this tomorrow and that the House can take it up on Tuesday and Wednesday we’d be back up and running,” Mnuchin said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
Asked if that agreement could come Sunday, Mnuchin said, “I’m hopeful. I think we’re very close to a deal today and I’m hopeful that we can get that done.”
Speaking on CNN moments after the Mnuchin interview, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed optimism for a deal.
“I’m very hopeful we could come to an agreement tonight or tomorrow morning,” the New York Democrat said.
Republican members of Congress have been pushing for a $250 billion deal to refund the $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program.
But Democrats want an additional $250 billion for local and state governments and hospitals that are on the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak.
“We’ve also reached an agreement on SBA disaster loans so there’ll be another $50 billion appropriated, which can do over $300 billion disaster loans. So these two programs are unprecedented response to small businesses,” Mnuchin said.
He noted that the new bill would include $75 billion for hospitals and testing.
More than 20 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past month.
Aid to local governments is not part of the bill.
Mnuchin said President Trump is “prepared to discuss that in the next bill” but “wants to get his over the finish line with a focus on small business, hospitals and testing.”
Mnuchin said White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are “on board.”"
258,Nearly 60 percent of Americans back stay-at-home restrictions: poll,https://nypost.com/2020/04/19/poll-6-in-10-support-stay-at-home-restrictions-to-fight-coronavirus/,2020-04-19 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Nearly 60% of Americans say they’re more concerned that loosening stay-at-home measures will cause further spread of the coronavirus than they are about what impact restrictions might have on the US economy, according to a new poll.
The NBC News/WSJ poll released Sunday found that 58% of registered voters worry the country will be too quick to lift the restrictions, leading the virus to spread and to more fatalities.
By comparison, there was another 32% who are more concerned that the country will take too much time to ease the restrictions, which will take a toll on the economy.
There appeared to be a partisan impact on the responses — with 77% of Democratic respondents and 57% of independents reporting they’re more concerned about the spread of the virus than the economy.
Meanwhile, Republicans were more divided with 39% more worried about the pandemic and 48% reporting that their greatest concern was about the economy, the poll said.
The poll was conducted from April 13 to 15 as some states have begun to talk about how to ease lockdown restrictions.
Pollsters surveyed more than 900 registered voters, more than half of whom were reached by cellphone."

At least 179 recovered South Korean coronavirus patients have tested positive again for the dangerous bug, officials said.
South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) announced Sunday that the tally accounted for 16 new cases detected of patients relapsing from the killer virus, CNN reported.
Patients in their 20s were responsible for the highest number of patients who have retested positive, the agency said.
There were 41 cases (22.9%) of patients in their 20s, followed by 32 cases (17.9%) of patients in their 50s, according to the KCDC.
Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the KCDC, said that an investigation is underway to determine why the patients were retesting positive.
Jeong has previously suggested that the virus may have been reactivated after remaining dormant in the patients, as opposed to them being reinfected.
South Korea has confirmed more than 10,600 COVID-19 cases, with more than 8,042 patients being cleared of the virus, officials said."

Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to President Trump, said the economy “may have turned a corner” as the governors look at ways to reopen their states during the coronavirus pandemic.
“Things look like we may have turned the corner,” Moore told John Catsimatidis on his AM-970 show “The Cat’s Roundtable” in an interview that aired Sunday. “States should lead the way. One state can learn from another. I think you are going to see … an opening of the Western and Midwestern states. I think the East Coast states are going to be a little slower.”
The coronavirus and the stay-at-home guidelines intended to curb its spread have decimated the economy as businesses close and workers are laid-off or furloughed.
More than 20 million people have filed unemployment claims in the past month.
The president last week announced guidelines that would allow governors to begin to reopen their state economies by May 1.
“Based on the latest data, our team of experts agree we can start the next front in our war, which we are calling Opening Up America Again, and that is what we are doing, opening up our country, and we have to do that,” Trump said at the White House briefing on Thursday.
States that show a downward trend in coronavirus cases could be the first to reopen businesses, bars, restaurants, theaters and gyms.
Moore, who is on a member of the White House panel advising Trump on reopening, said getting Americans back to work will boost the economy.
“Things are really looking brighter now. … In a month’s time we could really see the American economy up and running again,” Moore said.
“If we don’t do something soon, we are going to see 80% of our domestic oil production …shut down,” Moore continued. “That’s an industry that employs 5 million Americans.“"

Global Citizen’s star-studded “One World: Together at Home” concert came under fire as some criticized the televised event for raising money for the World Health Organization’s coronavirus response.
The two-hour primetime show curated by Lady Gaga raised more than $150 million for the organization’s Solidarity Response Fund, organizers said.
Elton John, Jennifer Lopez, Stevie Wonder, former US first ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush, Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion and Taylor Swift all participated in the special.
But critics of the WHO lashed out on social media in response to the broadcast event, which was the largest celebrity gathering so far to fight the pandemic.
“Each and EVERY ‘celebrity’ involved is a traitor to humankind and an equal conspirator is covering up the @WHO and Communist China’s CRIMES against humanity,” one Twitter user wrote.
The backlash comes as President Trump has accused the WHO of pro-China bias and not acting fast enough to confront the dangerous, new virus when it emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
“Why not raise money for out of work American citizens?” another user tweeted of the spectacle. “If these celebrities really cared they wouldn’t be supporting WHO. China lied and the WHO backed them.”

President Trump signaled his support of escalating protests against coronavirus restrictions — accusing certain states of being “unreasonable” with lockdowns that are too strict.
“I really believe that they’re being unreasonable,” Trump said at a White House briefing Saturday, a day after tweeting for Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia to be “liberated.”
“There are a lot of protests out there. And I just think that some of the governors have gotten carried away,” he said.
Trump criticized Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for being too strict in her state’s lockdown, and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam for gun-control measures that have nothing to do with the coronavirus.
Several such demonstrations have already taken place across the country in recent days, including in California, Michigan, Ohio and New Jersey.

“We’re close. We have common ground,” Pelosi said in an interview on ABC News’ “This Week” that will air Sunday. “I think we’re very close to agreement.”
The $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program went broke last week under overwhelming demand, leaving thousands of business owners in the lurch.
Congressional leaders are at a standoff in negotiating replenishing the relief fund and have been in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
GOP lawmakers have been pushing for an additional $251 billion for the small business loans, but Democrats have been holding out, seeking another $250 billion to be designated to local and state governments and hospitals that have taken huge financial hits while on the frontlines in the fight against the coronavirus.
President Trump has been ripping Democrats over the past few days for holding up the loan program.
“Lawmakers must stop blocking these funds and replenish the program without delay,” Trump said at the White House briefing on Saturday. “The Democrats have to come on board. I used to read that these were Democrat programs, not Republican. Seems to have switched around a lot, hasn’t it, huh? Switched around a lot. The Republicans want it. I think the Democrats probably do too, but they also want other things that are unacceptable.”"

The defiant revelers began filing in the eNVee Barbershop around 6 p.m. for a rap music video shoot that quickly spiraled into a raging party as music blasted from the single-story shop on Avenue L, residents told The Post.
“It was crazy. I think it’s unsafe. You’re putting cops in harm’s way. You’re putting all of us in harm’s way,” said a neighbor living several doors down.
By 10 p.m. a massive police presence had arrived — as large as the soiree itself.
Partygoers, many in their late teens and twenties, were handcuffed with zip ties and processed on the scene as more cops worked to keep the several dozen gawkers on the sidewalk at least six feet away from each other.
“We’re pioneering the anti-lockdown,” one suspect told The Post.
Under the coronavirus lockdown, residents must remain six feet apart while in public and gatherings of any size have been banned outright. Offenders face fines up to $1,000.
“It was a regular Brooklyn function. That’s the problem. We’re not supposed to have functions right now,” the neighbor said.
Attendees came out of the barbershop one by one and were searched, cuffed and ordered to sit on the sidewalk.
Reports of speakeasy restaurants and illicit shindigs have circulated as government officials try to keep people separated to quell the spread of the deadly virus. In New Jersey, the second-worst impacted state, Gov. Phil Murphy has repeatedly had to remind against “corona parties.”
“What you expect? People are stuck inside their house on Saturday night,” the neighbor in Canarsie said. “They want to go out and they can’t. It’s stressful.”"

The five fledglings seemed at ease in Brooklyn Bridge Park, Martinka said.
“It looked like they were sightseeing and enjoying themselves,” he said. “Two people walking a dog took cell phone photos, but no one else was around.”
The web-footed troop lingered on a Manhattan Bridge underpass for a few minutes before wobbling back into the grassy park.
“For sure they were enjoying the empty park,” Martinka said. “Absolutely.”
Not all New York City wildlife is flourishing under lockdown.

The coronavirus pandemic has punched a $7.4 billion hole in the city’s budget that only Congress and the Trump administration can patch, he said in a pair of cable news appearances.
Without the aid, the mayor said, the city would have to make “dangerous” cuts.
“It means all the things that people depend on in their lives — police, fire, sanitation, education — go down the list of all the things that makes any city, any town function,” the mayor said on MSNBC.
“If you’re missing $7 billion, I assure you, you have to stop — you have to start to cut that stuff back in ways that can be very dangerous.”
As Capitol Hill negotiates the next federal relief package, de Blasio slammed Trump for being “absolutely silent” on the economic crises facing American cities.
The mayor had on Thursday proposed a drastically-trimmed, $89.3 billion budget proposal.
But in addition to a cash injection, the city also needs a national testing plan if it is to safely end its lockdown, the mayor said minutes earlier on CNN.
“I want to restart the economy, too, but if New York City and cities all over the country don’t have testing we cannot restart,” the mayor said. “If we’re going broke and we can’t provide basic services for our people, we can’t restart.”
De Blasio described the early, slow response to the virus as a result of Trump’s failure to get increase testing capacity at the onset.
“Donald Trump blew it in January, in February, in March — he did not get us testing,” the mayor said. “If he had, it could have changed the entire course of this crisis.”"

“Sorry, we’re clothed,” reads the digital signet outside Little Darlings, a now-shuttered Las Vegas strip club that had stubbornly tried to remain open early on in the coronavirus outbreak.
The fully nude jiggle joint had tried to stay afloat by advertising “coronavirus-free” dancers, nude hand sanitizer wrestling and drive-thru strip shows — but to no avail.
The club sits just off a Vegas Strip that is now stripped of life.
The entirety of the famed boulevard has been shut down for the first time since the assassination of John F. Kennedy, according to The Guardian.
Like the nearly completely desolate Times Square, the abandoned Strip is a haunting illustration of an invisible pandemic.
Stragglers wandering through the country’s gambling epicenter are greeted with messages of hope on screens from closed casinos still patrolled by security guards. Palace Station’s sign announces, “Doors closed, hearts open.”
The closures are expected to devastate the state’s economy.
The Nevada Resort Association penned a letter to Congress asking for federal relief. The group estimated last month has warned the state has lost an estimated $2 billion from canceled meetings and conventions, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.
The shuttered strip could lead to nearly $39 billion in economic losses, the group said.
“This is an unprecedented economic situation that will have catastrophic financial ramifications for individuals, families, businesses and state and local budgets across the state,” the association’s President and CEO Virginia Valentine, wrote in the letter."

Sebastien Ibeagha still wakes up at 8 a.m and fixes himself breakfast. He gets a workout in, unless it’s a day off. Then he turns to one of life’s last pleasures unaffected by social distancing to fill his empty schedule: He flicks on his Xbox.
In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and the suspension of sports that followed thereafter, the New York City FC defender is one of many pro athletes now faced with a massive surplus of free time. He and several teammates are turning to “Call of Duty” to fill that void.
For some on the team, the game (they play the “Modern Warfare” title specifically) has been a very rough substitute for the intensity of pro sports. The club played Mexican giant Tigres on March 11 in the first leg of the CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinals, falling 1-0 in a tense affair and one of the club’s biggest matches ever. Now, some NYCFC players are maintaining that stimulation by yelling at their TVs instead.
“I think it makes me angry enough to where it kind of simulates stuff that happens on the field,” Ibeagha told The Post by phone.
Ibeagha and his most frequent gaming partner on the team — backup goalkeeper Brad Stuver — play “Call of Duty” for hours on end, now spending their days bemoaning “campers” (players who hide within the game) instead of missed calls on the field.
“Being a pro athlete, we don’t get to play the game we love [right now], but our entire life is about that competitive feeling. … And when we don’t get to go into training every day and have that, sometimes guys have a hard time filling that gap,” Stuver said.
Other NYCFC players are maintaining their sanity through different avenues.
After sleeping in, 17-year-old Joe Scally prefers to play “FIFA” with his brother or teammate (and fellow teenager) James Sands.
Veteran defender Anton Tinnerholm shrugs off gaming entirely.
“I’m too old to play ‘FIFA,’ ” the 29-year-old said on a recent conference call.
Not everyone is built to be a gamer — or even the same type of gamer.
Though Ibeagha and Stuver are heavily focused on the results of their “Call of Duty” exploits, their teammate Keaton Parks has a more lax approach to the game when he joins in.
“I’m there to hang out, you know,” the midfielder said to his teammates’ chagrin in a Google Hangouts video chat. “I’m not there to get dubs.”
“See, that’s the problem right there,” Ibeagha shot back.
Parks, who admits he’s the worst of the three at the game, plays it for just an hour or two at a time and largely uses it as a vehicle to interact with friends. His approach may be ridiculed by his uber-competitive teammates, but actually illustrates the game’s connective abilities amid MLS’s suspension of play.
NYCFC have done their part in keeping team members in touch. There’s an active WhatsApp group for players, coaches and support staff, and the team has organized several fitness classes over Zoom. But still, the stay-at-home guidelines have robbed athletes of almost all in-person interaction, so the makeshift locker room within “Call of Duty” has taken on a sense of heightened importance for Ibeagha, Stuver and Parks.
The banter the game enables hasn’t changed, but every “turn off your console” or genuine conversation through their headsets has now temporarily become the backbone of the trio’s real-life friendship.
“It allows us to vent in that type of way, to guys you usually see everyday,” Ibeagha said.
NYCFC’s gamers will still step away from their screens and occupy their time with other things, in addition to working out. Stuver reads and prepares meals, and Scally will occasionally be dragged outside by his dad to play basketball.
Still, it’s easy to see why gaming — with its social byproduct and rigor — can be uniquely addictive for athletes.
“Even if it’s not the same,” Stuver said, “it’s something.”"

Yes, but we got none of that when couple Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello dueted on “What A Wonderful World,” Louis Armstrong’s signature number, surrounded by candles like a Bonnie Tyler music video.
Or when Taylor Swift softly crooned “Soon You’ll Get Better” as though she was a hospital resident scrawling out a prescription.
Nearly every musician opted for the saddest, most obvious tune they could muster, while — lucky us! — giving a shaky tour of their fabulous homes that would make Robin Leach scowl.
If you didn’t know John Legend was an EGOT before, you sure do after gawking tonight at his awards shelf, conveniently located next to his piano.
Ellen DeGeneres’ floor-to-ceiling windows revealed lush California greenery. And Elton John, oddly, wanted us to witness his basketball hoop, complete with two basketballs on the driveway, as he barked “I’m Still Standing.”
The luxurious Trulia listings would have been forgiven were it not for the dull sanctimony paired with them.
Remember 1985’s Live Aid, held to raise money for the famine in Ethiopia? That international telethon provided one of Queen and Freddie Mercury’s most legendary performances. This downer, however, didn’t have half its energy.
Saturday night wasn’t even a telethon! Surely taking into consideration the skyrocketing unemployment figures of the coronavirus pandemic, co-host Stephen Colbert (alongside Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel) began by saying, “We’d love everyone to take out their wallets and throw them away. We aren’t asking for any money tonight.”
Even if the co-hosts didn’t land a joke all night, that’s a nice thought. What people want is a fun distraction, a celebration of the human spirit, right? But the next 118 minutes had no humor, no fun, no watchability.
The most memorable moments were, at best, weird.
Jennifer Lopez had, um, a conspicuously clean vocal track, as she sang “People” from “Funny Girl” in front of a campy tree covered in Christmas lights.
“There’s one thing I realized during this whole time,” Lopez said. “And that’s that we all need each other … PEOPLE!” You can’t make it up.
And Keith Urban performed “Higher Love” with two digital copies of himself. At the end of the tune, his wife, Nicole Kidman, came out and kissed one of the carbon copies. Strange, but at least it was uptempo.
One of the most vital performances was 76-year-old Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones doing “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.” That says it all, doesn’t it?
In the final song of the show, Lady Gaga, one of the event’s organizers, wedged herself into a famous duet: “The Prayer,” sung by Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli. The song — delivered by those two legends — has been a comfort to the world for 22 years. And still, Gaga had to get in there.
It was the final act of narcissism during a night dominated by it."
273,Science says: It’s time to start easing the lockdowns,https://nypost.com/2020/04/26/science-says-its-time-to-start-easing-the-coronavirus-lockdowns/,2020-04-26 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been enormous, and New York has suffered more than anywhere else in the world. Compared as a separate country, the New York area would rank, by far, as No. 1 for deaths per capita.
The New York-New Jersey-Connecticut tri-state area accounts for approximately 60 percent of all US deaths. Theories abound, but the New York area itself is different: New York is the top port of entry for the hundreds of thousands of tourists coming to the US every month from China; Gotham has a uniquely high density of living that swells daily by millions from workers and tourists; and Manhattan sees some 1.6 million commuters daily, mostly on crowded public transit, including 320,000 from Jersey alone.
Yet the pandemic toll is falling, dramatically so in New York, ­including both hospitalizations and deaths per day. Few doubt that the unprecedented isolation policies had a significant ­impact on “flattening the curves.”
Now, we face another, even greater problem: how to sensibly re-enter normal life. This must be based on what we now know, not on worst-case projections, using facts and fundamental medical knowledge, not fear or single-vision policies.
First, we know the risk of ­dying from COVID-19 is far lower than initially thought, and not significant for the overwhelming majority of those infected.
Multiple recent studies from Iceland, Germany, USC, Stanford and New York City all suggest that the fatality rate if infected is likely far lower than early estimates, perhaps under 0.1 to 0.4 percent, i.e., 10 to 40 times lower than estimates that motivated extreme isolation.
In the Big Apple, with almost one-third of all US deaths, the rate of death for all people ages 18 to 45 is 0.01 percent, or 13 per 100,000 in the population, one-eightieth of the rate for people age 75 and over. For people under 18, the rate of death is zero per 100,000. Of Empire State fatalities, almost two-thirds were over 70 years of age. And regardless of age, if you don’t already have an underlying chronic condition, your chances of dying are small. Of 7,959 NYC COVID-19 deaths fully investigated for underlying conditions, 99.2 percent had an underlying illness.
Second, protecting older, at-risk people helps prevent hospital overcrowding. Of New York City’s 38,000 hospitalizations, less than 1 percent have been patients under 18 years of age. Studying 4,103 confirmed COVID-19 patients with symptoms bad enough to seek medical care, Dr. Leora Horwitz of NYU Medical Center concluded: “Age is far and away the strongest risk factor for hospitalization.”
Recent studies show a far more widespread rate of infection and lower rate of serious illness than early World Health Organization reports that noted 80 percent of all cases were mild. The vast majority of younger, otherwise healthy people don’t get hospitalized.
Third, due to fear and the single-minded focus on COVID-19 regardless of cost, other people are dying. Critical medical care isn’t being provided. Millions of Americans have missed critical health care for fear of encountering the disease, and people are dying to make room for “potential” coronavirus patients.
When states and hospitals abruptly stopped “nonessential” procedures and surgery, that didn’t mean unimportant care. Treatments for the most serious illnesses, including emergency care, were missed. Some estimate about half of cancer patients deferred chemotherapy. Approximately 80 percent of brain surgery cases were skipped. Perhaps half or more of acute stroke and heart-attack ­patients missed their only chances for early treatment, some dying and many now facing permanent disability. Transplants from living donors are down 85 percent from the same period last year.
And that doesn’t include the skipped cancer screenings, avoided childhood vaccinations, missed biopsies of now-undiscovered cancers numbering thousands per week — and countless other serious disorders left undiagnosed.
Lastly, total isolation prevents broad population immunity and prolongs the problem.
We know from decades of medical science that infection causes individuals to generate an immune response (antibodies), and the population later develops immunity. Indeed, that is the main purpose of widespread immunization in other viral diseases: to assist with “herd immunity.”
In the COVID-19 epicenter, Gotham, higher immunity is likely, although undoubtedly muted by the extreme isolation. More than 20 percent of those tested had antibodies. While we don’t know with certainty that antibodies from COVID-19 stop infection, it would be expected, based on decades of virology science, including other coronavirus respiratory bugs, where immunity post-infection is thought to last for a year or more. That’s why scientists are hopeful about using COVID-19 antibodies to treat the sickest patients.
For population immunity, it is great news that half of infected people are asymptomatic and that medical care isn’t even necessary for the vast majority of people. That fact has been incorrectly portrayed as an urgent problem requiring mass isolation.
On the contrary, infected people are the immediately available vehicle for establishing widespread ­immunity. By transmitting the ­virus to others in lower-risk groups who then generate antibodies, pathways toward the most vulnerable people are blocked, ultimately eradicating the threat.
The curves have been flattened. Now, we must use established medical science and the evidence we have ­gathered, and for New York City in particular, limit the enormous harms accumulating from broad isolation and economic lockdown. While New York is unique, strategy should now focus on rigorously protecting the most vulnerable and strictly regulate access to senior-care centers.
Officials must issue rational distancing guidelines to the elderly and their families, including self-isolating the mildly sick. Masks could be required for public transit. We know children and young adults in good health have almost no risk of any serious illness from COVID-19, so logic means opening most schools. With sensible precautions and sanitization standards, most workplaces and businesses should reopen. This would save lives, prevent overcrowding of hospitals, restore vital health care for everyone and allow the socializing essential to generate immunity among those with little risk of serious consequences.

Andrew Cuomo said Sunday — a “terrible” loss, but the lowest number of daily fatalities recorded this month.
The overall toll rose to 16,966 on the strength of the new fatalities, recorded in the 24-hour period ending at midnight Sunday.
“That would normally be terrible news,” said Cuomo of the new deaths. “It’s only not terrible news compared to where we were.”
The daily death toll peaked at 799 on April 8, and the 367 losses represents the lowest 24-hour count since March 30, which saw 332 fatalities.
Total hospitalizations continued their gradual decline, as did new daily admissions, sitting Saturday at 1,087, also the lowest it’s been since late March.
Officials are watching the metrics with bated breath to make sure that the worst is truly over, Cuomo said.
“We’re still watching [the] big questions. How fast does that number continuing to come down?” he said, speaking specifically of total hospitalizations. “First, does that number continue to come down?
“Because that would be a nightmare if it ticks up.”"

A total of 16,673 New Yorkers have now been lost as of 2 p.m. Sunday, a jump of 403 from the last update at 1:30 p.m. Saturday.
That unthinkable tally includes 11,460 confirmed coronavirus fatalities, and 5,213 “probable” cases in which the deceased exhibited telltale signs of the disease, but weren’t officially tested, according to the city Department of Health.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier Sunday announced a confirmed statewide death toll of 16,966.
Unlike the five boroughs, Albany does not yet include “probable” deaths in its public accounting.
Meanwhile, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the city rose to 153,204 on Sunday — up 2,628 from Saturday."
276,Cuomo doubles down on ordering nursing homes to admit coronavirus patients,https://nypost.com/2020/04/26/cuomo-doubles-down-on-sending-coronavirus-patients-to-nursing-homes/,2020-04-26 00:00:00,"Gov. Cuomo doubled down Sunday on the state’s controversial directive ordering nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients.
The governor — who himself has described nursing homes as a “feeding frenzy’’ for the deadly coronavirus — said that the facilities can’t challenge a state regulation forcing them to admit patients with the contagion.
But he insisted that nursing homes could transfer those ill with the virus to another facility if the centers lacked such things as quarantine space, proper protective equipment and staff.
Asked by a reporter at his daily briefing Sunday if there was anything contradictory about his statements, the governor replied, “No.”
“A nursing home can only provide care for a patient who they believe they can provide adequate care for,’’ Cuomo said. “If they cannot provide adequate care for a patient, they must transfer that patient.”
He said that if the nursing home can’t find another adequate facility, it should call the state Department of Health.
“I have John, I don’t know where to send John,’’ Cuomo said of a possible nursing-home scenario. “Call the DOH, we’ll find a place for John. That’s how it works.
“We have vacancies in nursing homes and facilities,’’ the governor said.
The CEO of a hard-hit Brooklyn nursing home, where 55 patients have died from the coronavirus, told The Post last week that he’d been warning state Health Department officials for weeks he had staffing and equipment issues — yet received little help.
“There is no way for us to prevent the spread under these conditions,’’ the head of the Cobble Hill Health Center, Donny Tuchman, wrote in an e-mail to the department on April 8.
He said he asked to move some patients to the makeshift wards at Manhattan’s Javits Center and aboard the city-docked USNS Comfort amid the pandemic, only to be told those two spots were receiving only patients from hospitals.
“I made specific requests to transfer patients, and it didn’t happen,’’ Tuchman told The Post. “There weren’t options.”
The state said at the time that the facility was “able to meet basic needs under the directive — which included having adequate facilities.’’
State health workers also “conducted a focus survey at Cobble Hill and found no deficient practices,’’ a rep said.
“Additionally, as we track inventory for all facilities daily, our records indicate they have more than a week’s supply of N95 masks, two months’ supply of surgical masks, and nearly two weeks’ supply of gloves,” the spokesman added.
At least 3,500 nursing-home residents in the state have died from the coronavirus to date, including 2,000 in New York City, part of more than 16,000 overall.

As the COVID-19 lockdowns drag on and the local economic picture looks ever grimmer, the fiscal response by city officials — from Mayor Bill de Blasio on down — looks increasingly out to lunch.
Jobless numbers released Thursday hint that the nation is heading into Depression-era territory: With 26 million out of work, the US unemployment rate has now likely passed 20 percent; the 1930s peak was 25 percent. New York has been especially hard hit, with 1.4 million now without jobs.
The local economy is taking a massive hit, meaning huge drops — maybe $10 billion-plus — in Gotham’s tax revenue. How will the city pay its bills, its workers, its debts?
City Hall needs to imagine a whole new way of running government — an approach far different from what de Blasio’s mostly business-as-usual budget envisions.
The mayor’s $89.3 billion spending plan makes ends meet by tapping surplus revenue and reserve cash, making rosy assumptions about federal aid and projecting lower costs. Cuts? They’re a mere $2.7 billion over two years, barely 2 percent of the budget.
De Blasio’s plainly in denial.
Let’s be blunt: New York faces an epic emergency, warranting far more serious tightening — starting perhaps with a wage freeze for city workers, as Nicole Gelinas advised on these pages Thursday.
Roll back the municipal head count, too. And delay noncritical capital projects.
Charging up the economy — quickly and dramatically — would also help by producing more revenue, or at least containing losses.
Alas, the City Council is now looking to hobble businesses by, for instance, forcing them to pay workers bonuses of as much as $75 a day. Gelinas had a far more logical idea: Announce a sales-tax holiday and scrap the commercial-rent tax. Other mandates on businesses should be paused, too.
The city can weather this storm, just as it skated by bankruptcy in the ’70s. But government has to change drastically, as it did back then. The only other option is to go belly up."

279,How Yankees’ MLB Draft process is affected by coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/how-yankees-mlb-draft-process-is-affected-by-coronavirus/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"Inside six weeks of the MLB draft usually is crunch time for amateur scouting departments.
With a lot of players having not been seen since March, opinions have changed based on health, performance and signability. Cross-checkers are constantly on the move to get additional looks at players the club has interest in.
That was then.
This is now, when the only thing known is the draft will be held June 10 and be no more than 10 rounds, with the possibility it will be five. Last year it was 40.
With the coronavirus shutting down high school and college games, scouts are looking at prospective draft picks on video instead of getting a close-up look from the seats. Instead of a scout talking to the player face-to-face, it is done by video conferencing.
“We talk to them about their [abbreviated] season and how they think it went,’’ said Damon Oppenheimer, the Yankees’ head of amateur scouting since 2005, about the hour-long talks with potential draft picks who actually played college and high school games before baseball vanished. “It’s been a fact-finding mission on some of them and it’s been really good. It’s crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. Making sure the medical information that needs to be in is in. It is a lot of video and a lot of discussions. A lot of stuff we wouldn’t normally have the same amount of time to do because of seeing players. We are trying to capitalize on it and do the best we can.’’
While it has been somewhat beneficial partially due to the players being so comfortable about communicating with cell phones, attempting to evaluate players without seeing them in the meat of their schedules runs second to live eyes collecting information.
“I don’t think there is any substitute for watching kids playing baseball, watching them interact, watching them how they perform under pressure and things that aren’t necessarily on video, angles that aren’t on video,’’ said Oppenheimer, whose club owns the No. 28 pick. “You don’t know what the competition looks like. There are so many things that go into scouting an amateur player that don’t necessarily go on scouting a professional player.’’
For some players the last time a big league scout saw them play live was last summer. And while a lot can change from August to now for players 17 to 22, the more detailed those reports are the better.
“It’s a credit to the scouts that across the summer they made a true evaluation of a player and not just an identification of players that you are going to get to [see] them in the spring,’’ Oppenheimer said. “I think a lot of our guys put in the core hard work to evaluate them as if they were going to be drafted sooner.’’
Like so many work environments everywhere, there are hurdles to clear that never existed.
“It’s not ideal. Players get better, players change, players at this age we are scouting they grow and get stronger. The level of competition comes into play. Different levels of pressure, you see them under pressure,’’ Oppenheimer said. “It’s not the best way to do it, but it is what we are dealing with.’’"

President Trump on Sunday said he believes the coronavirus outbreak was the result of a “horrible mistake” in China — days after claiming he’d seen evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan lab.
The president was asked — during a Fox News virtual town hall at the Lincoln Memorial — whether there was enough evidence that China had misled the world about the deadly virus.
“Personally, I think they made a horrible mistake, and they didn’t want to admit it,” Trump responded.
“We wanted to go in, but they didn’t want us there. they made a mistake, they tried to cover it, like a fire… They couldn’t put out the fire.”
He said the US government was putting together a “strong” report on the origins of the virus, and how the Wuhan Institute of Virology might be involved. The report, he said, would be “very conclusive.”
Trump’s comments came days after he told reporters he’d seen proof that would suggest the virus originated in the lab, but said he couldn’t go into details.
The US intelligence community has said it believes that the novel coronavirus was not “manmade or genetically modified” but was still investigating whether it was caused by “an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”
Earlier on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that “a significant amount of evidence” suggested the virus came from the Wuhan lab.
“I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,” Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.” “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”
Chinese officials and scientists have denied any connection between the outbreak and the research facility.
During the Fox town hall, Trump accused China of suppressing information about the outbreak and allowing the virus to spread.
“What they really treated the world badly on, they stopped people going into China, but they didn’t stop people leaving China and going all over the world. I think they were embarrassed by the problem – very embarrassed,” Trump said.
“They allowed this to go into our country, other countries. This should never have happened. This virus should not have spread all over the world.”
In regards to President Xi Jinping, Trump says “I’m not going to say anything” but “this should never have happened.”"

Anti-viral drug remdesivir, which was approved Friday for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, is expected to be available to treat coronavirus patients as early as this week.
The announcement was made Sunday by Dan O’Day, the CEO of the pharmaceutical company making the drug, Gilead Sciences.
“We intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,” O’Day said on CBS’ “Face of the Nation.”
O’Day said his company has donated its entire available supply of remdesivir — totaling roughly 1.5 million vials — to the government, who will disperse the drug across the country on an as-needed basis.
“We did that because we acknowledge and recognize the human suffering, the human need here and want to make sure that nothing gets in the way of this getting to patients,” O’Day said of the donation.
O’Day said the government “will determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients are that need this medicine.”
One and half million vials of remdesivir — which has been shown through a federal trial to speed the recovery process of coronavirus patients — can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people, O’Day said."

The edict came down last Friday from SFPD Chief Bill Scott after officers generated controversy when they were seen wearing the masks at a May Day protest by homeless activists at an abandoned property.
“The San Francisco Police Department stands for safety with respect for all, and in consideration of concerns some community members have expressed that ‘thin blue line’ symbolism on some of our officers’ face masks may be perceived as divisive or disrespectful, we are taking steps with our officers and the Police Officers Association to provide alternative, neutral personal protective equipment,” Scott said in a statement. “In the midst of a global pandemic that has seen far too many first responders lose their lives, across the nation and around the world, it’s important to remember that the masks our officers wear were meant to honor all who make the ultimate sacrifice for the people we serve.”
“Thin Blue Line masks shall not be worn by our on-duty members,” he wrote in an email to members of the department, Fox 2 San Francisco reported. The department did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.
The flag has become identified with the pro-police “Blue Lives Matter” movement, which in turn has been seen as a response to the “Black Lives Matter” movement.
The chief also acknowledged the symbol dated back three decades and was adopted by the National Law Enforcement Officers’ Memorial, calling it a “meaningful expression to honor fallen officers.”
The San Francisco Examiner reported that after viewing video of a line of officers wearing the masks at the protest, Shamann Walton, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said, “that looks more like something you see below the Mason Dixon Line.”
The organizers of the protest in the city’s Castro neighborhood were from a homeless advocacy group, Reclaim SF."
283,How Big Tech is exploiting the coronavirus crisis to expand its power,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/big-tech-is-exploiting-coronavirus-crisis-to-expand-its-power/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Small businesses and tech startups are closing in droves. Yet by most accounts, Big Tech is sitting pretty. It’s another glaring inequity of the coronavirus fallout. Indeed, the dominant players will attempt to turn COVID-related surges in traffic and demand into long-term gains or simply scoop up bruised smaller competitors on the cheap.
Such opportunism should have antitrust authorities and lawmakers in Washington expediting the multiple ongoing inquiries and reviews into Big Tech. But Americans at large should be concerned on a much deeper level — since many of the giants have taken the opportunity of a crisis to double down on harmful practices and their cavalier attitude toward accountability and privacy.
Take Facebook’s content-review process, at once heavy-handed and ­inept. Despite a vow to crack down on truly dangerous anti-vaccination crankery, such content continues to blight the company’s social-media platforms, which include Instagram. Meanwhile, Facebook has been caught censoring perfectly legitimate content, such as a Post column by Steven Mosher raising questions about a Chinese virology lab’s ­potential role in the outbreak.
Meanwhile, Google has come under fire for running ads for essential products related to COVID-19. Like Facebook, Google had pledged not to cash in on the crisis and announced a ban on ads that capitalized on the virus. But Google’s policy also turned out to be woefully inadequate.
Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission slamming Google’s failure to prevent the misuse of its advertising platform. “Google has made repeated representations to consumers that its policies prohibit ads for products such as protective masks,” they wrote. “Yet the company appears not to be taking even rudimentary steps to ­enforce that policy.”
Taking a much different ­approach, Verizon donated millions in free advertising space “to support mental- and public-health-response efforts to address the novel coronavirus.” In particular, Verizon’s donation is meant to support diverse and high-risk populations impacted by the pandemic. The company is also offering creative and staff resources to help stand up campaigns for participating organizations.
Perhaps the worst example of a Big Tech company saying one thing and doing the opposite is Amazon, whose coronavirus ­response has been a disaster from the get-go. Early on, an investigation found that some 100 masks on sale on Amazon fell short of critical safety standards. Then came the price-gouging: Amazon said it had warned sellers about sudden price hikes, but sellers said the company’s enforcement approach was haphazard.
Amazon’s failure to protect its warehouse workers has also been well-documented. Criticism and protests organized by Amazon employees have been taking place from the start of the pandemic.
In March, after an assistant manager at an Amazon warehouse in New York organized an employee walkout, Amazon fired him and hatched a plan to smear his name. Just last week, Amazon doubled down on its apparent intimidation campaign and canned two internal critics of its coronavirus response.
Amazon has been trying to do damage control with hiring ­announcements, but what good are new jobs at a company that treats workers as disposable?
It’s notable, too, that some of Amazon’s more traditional retail competitors have done far more to serve the public good. Walmart, for example, immediately sprang to action, with decisions like reserving designated shopping times for vulnerable populations. Walmart has also demonstrated a strong command of its supply chain.
Others might say this is Amazon’s first go-round as a major retailer with a crisis of this magnitude. And that’s partly true; the likes of Walmart have had more experience, having participated in the response to Hurricane Katrina. But isn’t this always the excuse of Big Tech: that they are learning in real-time and adjusting as best they can?
It’s time to hold Amazon, Facebook, Google and others to the same standards as everyone else. Their response to the coronavirus has provided a stark reminder of their reckless practices, greed and shirking of accountability. They are leveraging this crisis to expand their power, putting profits first.

President Trump fielded questions from worried Americans during a televised town hall about the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday — and predicted that a vaccine would be ready by the end of 2020.
“We think we are going to have a vaccine by the end of this year,” Trump said during the two-hour Q&A aired on Fox News.
Experts had previously estimated that a vaccine would take up to 18 months, if not longer — but White House coronavirus task force expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said last month he thought it was within the “realm of possibility” that millions of vaccines could be ready by January.
Speaking from the Lincoln Memorial, Trump said he didn’t care if another country had an immunization ready first, adding: “I really just want to get a vaccine that works.”
News of the vaccine timeline came as Trump increased his projection for the total number of US fatalities from the virus to 80,000 or 100,000 — up more than 20,000 from what he’d suggested just a few weeks ago.
“That’s a horrible thing,” Trump said. “We shouldn’t lose one person over this.”
As of Sunday, more than 66,000 Americans had been felled by the disease, according to a tally of reported deaths from Johns Hopkins University.
Trump said he’d like to see “therapeutics” to combat COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration recently authorized the emergency use of anti-viral drug Remdesivir, and Trump also continued to tout the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine.
Facing questions from people put out of work as a result of the outbreak, Trump stressed the importance of revving up the virus-stricken economy.
“We have to get it back open safely but as quickly as possible.”
Roughly 30.3 million people have filed for unemployment aid in the six weeks since nonessential businesses were ordered closed to stem the spread of the outbreak.

285,"Brazil’s Bolsonaro headlines anti-democratic rally, amid alarm over handling of virus",https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/brazils-bolsonaro-headlines-anti-democratic-rally-amid-alarm-over-handling-of-virus/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro attacked Congress and the courts in a speech to hundreds of supporters on Sunday as the number of coronavirus cases blew past 100,000 in Brazil, underlining the former army captain’s increasing isolation as he downplays the impacts of the pandemic.
Right-wing Bolsonaro has drawn widespread criticism from across the political spectrum for dismissing the threat of the virus in Brazil, which has registered 101,147 confirmed cases and 7,025 deaths, according to the most recent data from the Health Ministry.
On Sunday, dozens of public figures signed an open letter to the Brazilian government calling on officials to protect the nation’s indigenous people, who often live in remote locations with limited access to healthcare.
At the same time, Bolsonaro faces the most serious political crisis of his mandate, after his popular justice minister, Sergio Moro, quit last week and accused the president of firing the federal police chief in a bid to appoint a personal ally to the post and obstruct graft probes targeting his sons.
Brazil’s Supreme Court blocked Bolsonaro’s pick for a new chief on Wednesday, enraging the president.
On Saturday, former justice minister Moro, among Brazil’s most popular public figures due to his tough stance on graft, presented testimony regarding possible obstruction of justice by Bolsonaro. Hours before, the president called Moro “Judas” on Twitter, referring to the apostle that betrayed Jesus.
As Bolsonaro’s relationship with legislators and the courts has cooled, he has become increasingly dependent on a cadre of advisers in his government who are active or former military.
As in an April rally also attended by Bolsonaro, demonstrators on Sunday called for the closing of the Supreme Court and Congress, and a return to authoritarian measures used during Brazil’s 1964 to 1985 military regime.
“We have the armed forces at the people’s side: the side of order, democracy, liberty,” Bolsonaro said in a speech transmitted live on Facebook.
“We want the best for our country. We want three truly independent branches (of government).”"

“In the Trump years, the sector of society we used to describe as liberal America became a giant finger-wagging machine,” laments Matt Taibbi in his latest newsletter. “The news media, academia, the Democratic Party, show-business celebrities and masses of blue-checked Twitter virtuosos became a kind of umbrella agreement society, united by loathing of Trump and fury toward anyone who dissented with their preoccupations.” The coronavirus crisis gave this “scolding utopia” an opportunity to move beyond “abstraction”: “Failure to take elite advice was no longer just a deplorable faux pas. Not heeding experts was now murder.” Think pieces range from cheering China’s control of the Internet over the “unwashed” to accusing governors who want to reopen their states of “human sacrifice.” Dangerously, “we’ve lost the ability to decouple scientific or policy discussions, or simple issues of fact, from a political argument.” Discussion of “the COVID-19 crisis has become the latest in a line of moral manias with Donald Trump in the middle.”
Culture critic: NYC Arts After Corona
At City Journal, Lawrence Perelman wonders: “As commerce resumes in the months ahead, how will dancers, actors and athletes perform in intimate concert halls and theater quarters and arenas?” After all, “the show must go on,” and as audiences tend to “make up the majority of people at any performance,” that means arenas and performing-arts institutions are going to have to figure out how to respond. “The now-standard ‘no-cellphones’ announcement, for example, could be accompanied by a new warning: ‘If you’re not feeling well, you shouldn’t be here.’ Carnegie Hall could replace its Ricola lozenge dispensers with masks and Purell.” But one thing is certain: “The performance arts can’t afford months of inactivity.”
Urban beat: The End of New York?
New York City, “the predominant urban center in North America,” faces “a looming existential crisis” thanks to the coronavirus, Joel Kotkin warns at Tablet. While all cities “pay a price for being both dense and cosmopolitan” during pandemics, the virus will hit New York’s economy and “social fabric” especially hard — because they were “already unraveling before the outbreak began.” In large part, that’s because of mayors like Michael Bloomberg and Bill de Blasio, whose policies “starkly divided” the city, hurting the middle class and accelerating homelessness. If the Big Apple “does not change direction” and focus on the middle class rather than the ruling “city employee unions, professional ideologues” and the “mega-rich,” Kotkin worries, it will dig itself into “a very deep hole” indeed.
Conservative: Of Accusers and Their Parents
Democrats and their media allies are doing all they can to sidestep, ­ignore, bury or outright debunk Tara Reade’s sexual-assault allegations against Joe Biden — “a far cry,” sighs The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, “from their shared ­attempt to destroy the life and reputation of Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings.” They insist the cases are different, and in one crucial sense, they are: Reade’s late mother “was ­upset enough about whatever happened with Biden to call into a national television show to discuss it” in 1993. Meanwhile, “Christine Blasey Ford’s family was conspicuously quiet during the Kavanaugh ordeal.” Indeed, her extended family had significant doubts about her allegations, and her father went so far as to privately ­express his support for Kavanaugh’s nomination.
Iconoclast: Enough Talk of ‘Her’ Truth
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand recently invited Joe Biden accuser Tara Reade into a “space for all women to come forward to speak their truth” — prompting The Week’s Matthew Walther to ask: “What does it mean to suggest that Reade and other women who claim to have been sexually assaulted have a truth all their own, one to which something other than a definite article is prefixed?” Whatever Gillibrand’s intentions, such postmodern rhetoric doesn’t help ­alleged victims — rather, it places their claims “outside the boundaries of truth.”

287,Southwest Airlines CEO claims it’s safe to fly despite coronavirus pandemic,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/southwest-airline-ceo-claims-its-safe-to-fly-despite-coronavirus/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"The CEO of Southwest Airlines claimed Sunday that it’s safe to fly again despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Speaking on “Face the Nation” on CBS, Gary Kelly said the airline had taken extreme measures to ensure passengers would be safe from the COVID-19 virus and that the company’s jets were “as safe as humanly possible.”
“We’re doing everything possible to encourage people to come back and fly,” Kelly told Margaret Brennan. “We’re cleaning airplanes, we’re requiring masks of our employees and our customers, we’re using very deep cleaning overnight, we’re using electrostatic misters which will kill the virus on surfaces for up to 30 days.”
“We’re exercising social distancing on board the aircraft,” Kelly said. “We won’t be booking airplanes full so that people can spread out. So, absolutely we’re doing everything we can to make it as safe as humanly possible.”
Kelly’s remarks come after other major airlines, including Delta, United, American, and JetBlue, announced that passengers would be required to wear protective masks on flights and that other safety measures against the coronavirus would be put in place.
The airline industry has been hard hit by the virus, which has reduced air travel to a bare minimum amid lockdowns and travel restrictions — and Southwest is no exception.
Kelly said nearly 400 of the airline’s fleet has been grounded during the lockdown.
“The demand is not there,” he told Brennan. “So, obviously if things don’t improve we have to downsize.”
“We’ve never had a furlough in our history, we’ve never had a pay cut in our history, and I’m extraordinarily proud of that. We certainly don’t want to break that record. What I had promised our people is I don’t know what the future holds but I do know that we are very well prepared.”
He said the last measure for the financially strapped air carrier would be involuntary furloughs for the airline’s more than 60,000 employees."
288,"NYC coronavirus cases reach nearly 170,000, death toll at over 18,000",https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/new-york-city-coronavirus-cases-reach-nearly-170000/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the five boroughs neared 170,000 on Sunday — hours after Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the city must remain on high alert for a possible “boomerang.”
A total of 168,845 New Yorkers have now been diagnosed with the bug, according to statistics from the city’s Department of Health.
That count includes 1,962 new cases tallied between Saturday’s 3:15 p.m. accounting and Sunday’s 1:30 p.m. update.
A staggering 18,706 city residents have now succumbed to confirmed or suspected cases of the contagion, the agency said.
That grim toll includes 13,319 confirmed to have had the bug and 5,387 “probable” cases in which the deceased displayed symptoms of the disease, but were not formally tested, according to the DOH."
289,Advocates demand full benefits for city workers killed by coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/advocates-demand-full-benefits-for-city-workers-killed-by-coronavirus/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"Advocates for essential city workers are demanding the municipal employees killed by the coronavirus receive full, line-of-duty death benefits — even if it’s unclear whether they contracted the contagion on the clock or on their own.
With at least 245 city workers dead from the global pandemic so far, union leaders and elected officials are teaming up to demand that cops, firefighters and others who put themselves on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19 be treated as “line of duty” casualties.
Among those leading the charge has been City Councilman Joe Borelli of Staten Island, who is calling on Mayor Bill de Blasio to extend death benefits to the families of city workers who die of coronavirus until the state can hammer out a longer-term solution.
“Health officials made a determination that this disease was so deadly that the general public must stay home and yet we still asked certain essential workers to show up every day,” Borelli told Politico. “If they had to go to work in a dangerous situation, then they contracted it in the course of their duty.”
As of last week, 68 city Department of Education employees, 38 healthcare workers, 37 police officers, 27 social service workers, and 10 firefighters numbered among the city’s coronavirus casualties — in some cases leaving their families scrambling for economic survival.
In addition, the departments of correction and mental health have both lost 10 employees, while the Administration for Children’s Services has bid farewell to seven, city officials said.
The deaths have been particularly difficult for cops and firefighters who passed from the virus short of the 20-year threshold to qualify for a full state pension.
Under current law, the family of a police officer who dies short of 20 years of service is entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to three times the cop’s annual salary. That’s short of the line-of-duty benefit that provides survivors with continued health benefits and an annual percentage of the officer’s salary.
Politico highlighted the case of one NYPD cop killed by the coronavirus one year shy of retirement from the force.
Det. Raymond Abear, who planned on buying a waterfront home in Florida for his wife and two young children, died at age 43 last month, the outlet said.
Abear’s death left his 37-year-old wife, Catherine — a stay-at-home mom — with no income or health insurance.
“We made the decision together that he would work and support our family financially and I would stay home and raise our children,” Catherine Abear told Politico. “Right now I’m in a position where I have to immediately figure out both of those roles.”
Union officials worry that pension boards will not classify deaths like Abear’s as “line of duty” deaths, which would mean families receive far fewer benefits.
PBA President Pat Lynch likened the struggle to the lengthy fight for benefits for workers who lost their lives at Ground Zero in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks.
“We just finished an 18-year fight to secure treatment and benefits for all of our 9/11 heroes,” Lynch said. “Our elected leaders absolutely cannot put the heroes of this pandemic through the same ordeal. Police officers could not protect our health by sheltering in place.”
“We had to be out on the streets in every part of the city, interacting with both healthy New Yorkers and sick ones, without adequate protective equipment,” he said. “Those who were made ill by their service to the city — especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice — need to be guaranteed full line of duty benefits.”
Detectives’ Endowment Association President Paul DiGiacomo said the detectives who died of the illness were “undoubtedly essential workers and did not have the option to stay home.”
“These heroes dedicated their lives to keeping our city safe — taking care of people during the pandemic and well before this crisis,” DiGiacomo said. “The cheers and praise from elected officials are nice, but now they must ensure they take care of the loved ones left behind. With children as young as six months old, these families and the fallen Detectives who were relied upon to serve on the front lines deserve nothing less.”
In a statement Sunday, de Blasio said the burden of picking up the additional tab should fall on Washington.
“The President left New Yorkers without the tools we needed to protect ourselves; the least he can do now is support families who have suffered unspeakable loss,” the mayor said. “The federal government should provide death benefits to those eligible.”"
290,Eleven Madison Park chef will keep feeding needy New Yorkers after coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/eleven-madison-park-chef-to-continue-to-feed-needy-new-yorkers/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park will be changing the way he runs his restaurant after the pandemic lifts to better help feed the hungry, Side Dish has learned.
Humm, whose three-starred Michelin restaurant was named the world’s best in 2017, is amping up his role at a non-profit, Rethink Food NYC, to become its top chef and inaugural partner as it expands nationally.
Before COVID-19, Rethink turned restaurant waste into meals, feeding 15,000 people a week. The non-profit now serves 25,000 meals a day.
Post COVID-19, restaurant staff at Eleven Madison will make extra “family meals” for Rethink to feed needy New Yorkers.
“If every restaurant does this, we could end hunger,” said Matt Jozwiak, Rethink Food NYC’s executive director and founder, who formerly worked at Humm’s Michelin-rated restaurant.
Currently, Humm has turned Eleven Madison Park into a food commissary to help make meals for Rethink to distribute during the crisis.
“This has been a life-changing time, and I am really happy to be able to do what we are doing,” said Humm, who bikes from his Upper East Side home to Madison Park every day.
“But after the crisis, the next chapter is to incorporate feeding people in need every day. We are producing inexpensive but delicious staff meals.”"

Can you pray the coronavirus away?
A new scientific study is examining the power of prayer in those fighting for their lives from COVID-19 — testing for “true supernatural intervention,” according to a report.
The Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute is testing 1,000 patients in intensive care with the contagion — with half getting a “universal” prayer offered in five denominational forms.
The four-month study will then compare death rates as well as time in ICU and on ventilators.
“We all believe in science, and we also believe in faith,” the study’s lead investigator, cardiologist Dr. Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy, told NPR.
“If there is a supernatural power, which a lot of us believe, would that power of prayer and divine intervention change the outcomes in a concerted fashion? That was our question.”
He stressed, “It has to be a true supernatural intervention.”
Lakkireddy admitted that even his own wife, a fellow physician, is “skeptical.”
“But it’s not like we’re putting anyone at risk,” he told NPR. “A miracle could happen. There’s always hope, right?”
The study is formally investigating “the role of remote intercessory multi-denominational prayer on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients,” according to its listing on the National Institutes of Health. The prayer is offered in variations for Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism.
“I believe in the power of all religions,” Lakkireddy told NPR.
“I think if we believe in the wonders of God and the universal good of any religion, then we’ve got to combine hands and join the forces of each of these faiths together for the single cause of saving humanity from this pandemic.”"

The depraved fiend followed the 32-year-old Upstate New York woman into a Hamilton Heights apartment building on 149th Street and Broadway, Friday at around 9 p.m., according to the NYPD and police sources.
He then punched her in the face and tried to tear off her pants, cops said.
But the brave healthcare worker was able to fight the sicko off — and he fled with her cellphone.
She was bruised up, but refused medical attention.
Police released surveillance photos and videos of the man wanted in the stomach-churning incident, who was spotted exiting the lobby of a building with a blue scarf draped over his head.
“This is a terrible situation for people pouring their love into New York City and then to be treated as victims,” a police source said.
More than 90,000 retired and active health care workers have signed up to volunteer in the Empire State, including at least 21,000 from outside New York, the governor’s office said last month.
Several hotels and companies have offered discounted housing for medical staffers lending a hand in Gotham amid the pandemic.
It was unclear if the nurse was renting the apartment where the alleged attack occurred — or whether she remained in New York City following the harrowing ordeal.
Anyone with information is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website at WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM, or on Twitter @NYPDTips."
293,Out-of-work chefs are leaving NYC to cook for billionaires,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/out-of-work-chefs-are-leaving-nyc-to-cook-for-billionaires/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"Chefs from some of New York City’s top restaurants are leaving the business to work for billionaires after losing their jobs to the coronavirus, Side Dish has learned.
Out-of-work chefs from Jean-Georges, Daniel, Eleven Madison Park, Per Se and Gramercy Tavern are being poached by talent agents and even real estate brokers to work for wealthy families since the coronavirus shutdowns have eviscerated the restaurant industry, sources said. The supply of quality chefs is so abundant that some wealthy people say they’re getting cold called about the latest candidate.
“I received a call out of the blue asking if we wanted to hire a top chef who had worked for Jean-George’s,” one billionaire real estate developer told Side Dish.
For unemployed chefs, it’s often the only way for them to make money doing what they love at a time when sit-down dining is prohibited by the state lockdown.
“I was laid off six weeks ago. It just wasn’t possible to stay, no matter how much the chef wanted to keep us. I can’t stand not working. I miss being in the kitchen,” said Ian Tenzer, a 29-year-old former sous chef at three-star Michelin restaurant Eleven Madison Park, named the world’s best restaurant in 2017.
“Working as a private chef has always been a part of the industry I had thought about working in and, at this point in my career, it’s a good choice economically and professionally,” he added.
Indeed, chefs who choose to work in private homes stand to get a 20 percent to 30 percent pay raise, as well as other perks including better hours, sources said. Sous chefs at top restaurants can earn between $120,000 and $200,000 a year working full-time for a family, compared to closer to $100,000 working at a restaurant.
Personal chefs also commonly earn discretionary bonuses, especially if they are being asked to shelter in place with their families during the COVID-19 pandemic, says David Youdovin, chief executive of Hire Society, which helps individuals recruit private staff.
“The vast majority of restaurant chefs are grossly underpaid, and seldom receive benefits,” and now clients are being “very generous and accommodating,” Youdovin said.
One drawback is that you never know what kind of family you’ll get, chefs said. Some families are “lovely, adventurous and curious,” but others can be quite the opposite. They can be rude and “even physically and verbally abusive. I have heard horror stories,” said one chef who asked to remain unnamed. “Money can be a very corrupting influence.”
Working in a restaurant, by contrast, gives rising chefs an opportunity to learn from the best, and there’s often a strong sense of camaraderie that can’t be replicated in a private home.
“When you work in a restaurant, you are part of a team. There are peers you look up to and others you teach. The team becomes your family and you learn to love everyone. That’s the hardest part about leaving [the restaurant job],” Tenzer explained.
The pandemic also has made the interviewing process more challenging. Normally, people vying for a private chef position will cook up “tastings” for families in their own kitchens, but now chefs are preparing tastings in their own homes and then dropping them off at their prospective employer’s front door.
This social-distancing measure, along with virtual interviews by Zoom or FaceTime, are making it tough for both the chefs and families to determine if they are making a good match, Youdovin said.
“Part of being a private chef is being able to interact with the family, the kids, their guests. It’s about having the right charisma for the family. Some are more formal than others. It’s about chemistry as well as tastings,” Youdovin added.
For some chefs, the new gigs are short-term, until the pandemic subsides. Brokers Dolly and Jenny Lenz, who deal in high-end real estate, say they have sourced two top chefs for two different families who have rented Hamptons estates to wait out the crisis. People quarantining in rental homes are often looking to hire chefs, nannies and housekeepers to shelter in place with them during this time, Dolly Lenz said.
“The families interviewed the chefs and hired them,” Dolly Lenz said. “The hard part is that the chefs had to agree to shelter in place. They can’t leave. But they are only staying until the city opens up and they can go back to their restaurants.”"
294,Pompeo says ‘enormous evidence’ shows coronavirus began in Wuhan lab,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/pompeo-enormous-evidence-shows-coronavirus-began-in-wuhan-lab/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said “enormous evidence” exists indicating the coronavirus pandemic began in a lab in Wuhan, China and that the ruling Communist Party did everything it could to keep the outbreak under wraps.
“There’s enormous evidence that that’s where this began. We’ve said from the beginning that this was a virus that originated in Wuhan, China. We took a lot of grief for that from the outset. But I think the whole world can see now,” he said on ABC News’ “This Week” on Sunday.
“Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”
After the first cases were reported in Wuhan in December, Pompeo said Beijing began a “disinformation” campaign that “created enormous risk” around the world.
“China behaved like authoritarian regimes do, attempted to conceal and hide and confuse. It employed the World Health Organization as a tool to do the same. These are the kind of things that have now presented this enormous crisis, an enormous loss of life and tremendous economic cost, all across the globe,” Pompeo said.
There are now nearly 3.5 million cases around the world and more than 245,000 people have died from COVID-19.
Asked by host Martha Raddatz if he believed the virus was man-made or genetically modified, Pompeo cited “experts” saying it was man-made.
But Raddatz pointed out that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the scientific consensus is that COVID-19 was not man-made or genetically modified.
“That’s right. I agree with that. Yeah. I’ve seen their analysis. I’ve seen the summary that you saw that was released publicly. I have no reason to doubt that that is accurate,” he said.
Pompeo said it still hasn’t been determined whether China intentionally released the virus or it was a lab accident.
“I think there’s a lot to know. But I can say this. We’ve done our best to try and answer all of those questions. We tried to get a team in there. The World Health Organization tried to get a team in there. And they have failed. No one’s been allowed to go to this lab or any of the other laboratories — there are many labs inside of China,” he said. “This risk remains.”"
295,NY to partner with six states to stock up for possible second coronavirus wave,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/ny-will-team-up-with-states-to-stock-for-another-coronavirus-wave/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"New York will partner with six other Northeast states to buy critical coronavirus supplies, and Empire State officials will mandate hospitals statewide to stockpile at least 90 days’ worth of protective gear in preparation for a possible second wave of the contagion, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.
“We’re going to form a consortium with our seven northeast partner states,” Cuomo said in a press briefing at his Midtown Manhattan office, counting New York among the total. “They’ve acted as neighbors.”
New York and its six partners — New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts — will now enter the marketplace together to buy some $5 billion of personal protective equipment, tests, ventilators and other equipment from companies and overseas suppliers.
The seven states are already partnered to move towards a gradual reopening of their respective economies.
Previously, states engaged in bidding wars with each other — and even the Federal Emergency Management Agency — in the mad dash to stock up before the worst of the coronavirus hit.
The competition served only to drive up prices, force states to turn to dodgy private sellers and leave some stuck out in the cold, Cuomo said.
“Let’s see if we can’t do the purchasing in this region,” the governor said. “This consortium, I think, will help us get the equipment and get it at a better price.”
Additionally, Cuomo said that all hospitals statewide would be required to build up a cache of at least 90 days’ worth of PPE so that a possible recurrence of the coronavirus doesn’t catch the state off guard.
“We can’t go through this day-to-day moving [of] masks all across the state,” said Cuomo, referring to the balancing act that facilities had to perform on the fly to ensure that all hospitals had enough to get by. “We can’t go through this again.”
The governor laid out battle plans for a potential second wave as the virus’ first strike continued to kill hundreds of New Yorkers.
Another 280 succumbed to the bug in the 24-hour period ending at midnight Sunday, raising the state’s overall death toll to 19,189.
Though the daily fatalities continued on a general downward trend, Cuomo said the losses remained “tremendously distressing.”
“The overall direction is good, even though it’s very painful,” he said."
296,Americans turn to hunting amid fears of coronavirus food shortages,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/americans-turn-to-hunting-amid-fears-of-coronavirus-food-shortages/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"More Americans are turning to hunting during the coronavirus pandemic — and amid fears of nationwide food shortages after meat plants were forced to halt operations over outbreaks.
“People are starting to consider self-reliance and where their food comes from,” Hank Forester of Quality Deer Management Association said, adding that he believes there will be a hunting resurgence over empty grocery store shelves.
Outbreaks have recently caused at least three major meat producers — Tyson Foods, JBS USA and Smithfield Foods — to shutter more than a dozen plants across the nation.
Meanwhile, some states have seen a jump in hunting licenses — including Indiana, where there was a 28% increase in turkey hunting license sales during the first week of the season.
Game and fish agencies from Minnesota to New Mexico have seen an increase in either hunting license sales or permit applications.
Nina Stafford, a building contractor from Fayetteville, Georgia, killed her first deer in January, but has come to see hunting as a viable alternative if stores are hit with shortages over the closures.
“The coronavirus has only made me want to go and do it more so that I don’t have that scared feeling of where’s my next meal going to come from,” said 42-year-old Stafford, who also grows vegetables and fruit.
David Elliot, an emergency manager at Holy Cross Hospital in Taos, New Mexico, said he began to consider big game hunting when the virus hit the US back in January and applied for a permit to hunt elk.
“I understand some people might be driven by like antlers or some sort of glory. I don’t want to do that,” Elliot, 37, said.
Since he doesn’t own a rifle, Elliot said he plans to borrow one to hunt female elk in an area of Taos County.
“I want to make sure it’s a clean, humane shot, as much as possible, and get a bunch of food,” Elliot said.

297,Joe Biden wins Kansas primary conducted with all-mail balloting,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/joe-biden-wins-kansas-primary-conducted-with-all-mail-balloting/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"TOPEKA, Kan. — Joe Biden has overwhelmingly won a Democratic presidential primary in Kansas that the state party conducted exclusively by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The former vice president had been expected to prevail in Saturday’s vote and capture a majority of the state’s delegates to the Democrats’ national nominating commission. Biden took 77% of the vote.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was still in the race when the Kansas party began mailing ballots at the end of March, but he suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden.
Biden won 29 delegates and Sanders got 10, inching Biden closer to the number of delegates he needs to clinch the Democratic nomination. He has a total of 1,435 delegates and needs 1,991 to win the nomination on the first ballot at the party’s national convention this summer, a threshold Biden is likely to reach in June after many states postponed their primaries. Sanders has 984 delegates, according to the count by the Associated Press released Sunday.
Democratic leaders originally had planned to set up polling places across the state in addition to allowing mail balloting. But they scrapped plans for in-person voting at the end of March after Kelly issued a statewide stay-at-home order, and the change nearly tripled participation over four years ago, with 34.7% of registered Democrats casting ballots.
“Kansas Democrats made history in this election with record participation levels along with demonstrating how a vote-by-mail election can protect voters and our democracy, even in the most uncertain of times,” party chairwoman Vicki Hiatt said in a statement. “We are confident the enthusiasm and engagement seen during the 2020 Primary will only continue to grow and translate into Democratic victories up and down the ballot in November.”
A Democratic presidential candidate hasn’t carried Kansas in November since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
Sanders easily won Kansas’ caucuses in 2016 over former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, riding a surge of enthusiasm among liberal voters and first-time caucus-goers. But the state party mailed ballots this year to more than 400,000 registered Democrats to get a far larger turnout than the 39,000 who voted four years ago.
The primary determined how 39 of the state’s 45 national convention delegates would be allocated. The remaining six are party leaders, including Gov. Laura Kelly and U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids.
Besides Biden and Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard also were on the Kansas ballot. Voters also could choose to be uncommitted.
The contest also featured ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to pick more than one candidate and rank them. The lowest vote-getter — Gabbard in this case — was then eliminated, and her votes redistributed to the other choices in a second round if voters listed a second choice. That process continued until only candidates with at least 15% of the vote remained, eventually only Biden and Sanders."

“Testing is the key — testing has always been the key,” Hizzoner said at a press briefing Sunday, saying it would help make sure any social-distancing orders were lifted safely to avoid “the dreaded boomerang.”
“For the first time in the city’s history, we will have our own test kits produced in large numbers right here in the five boroughs,” he said, calling the pioneering move “uncharted territory.”
The first 30,000 city-printed swabs will be available by Friday, with production “on track thereafter for 50,000-a-week,” the mayor said.
Hizzoner noted the “painful, painful irony” that the key swabs used in test kits were previously made in the region of northern Italy that became an epicenter for the contagion, crippling production.
“The global market wasn’t working … so we decided we would make our own,” de Blasio said.
He praised the “tremendous talent in this city” for getting the kits made quickly, with local 3D printing company Print Parts making the swabs.
The city has said it will produce swabs and plastic tubes needed for the tests — but the Viral Transport Medium that samples are transported in will come from outside the Big Apple until May 17, when Bronx-based Albert Einstein College of Medicine should be able to produce the media itself, he said, making the tests completely city-made.
There is still a dearth of labs to actually process the tests, however, de Blasio warned.
“Now we need [federal] help with lab capacity, we’re still not getting the help we need and we’re gonna keep fighting for it,” he said.
Ultimately, widespread testing will “help us go on the offensive — testing, tracing, isolating, quarantining,” the mayor said.
It added up to “all the pieces needed to fight back this disease and avoid that dreaded boomerang,” he said, highlighting Hong Kong, Singapore and the Japanese island of Hokkaido as places that needed tougher lockdowns after lifting restrictions too soon."
299,Pregnant nurse with PTSD ordered back to work after coronavirus recovery,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/pregnant-nurse-with-ptsd-ordered-back-to-work-after-coronavirus/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
A pregnant Brooklyn nurse burdened by the guilt of passing coronavirus to her family is being dragged back to work on the front-lines — against her doctors’ advice and despite a nasty case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, The Post has learned.
“It’s scary not knowing the long term effects that this virus could possibly have on my overall well-being, my health, my mental health,” Tamekia Melong, a 31-weeks-pregnant nurse at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, told The Post. “It’s scary not knowing if I could get reinfected again…and it’s scary if I passed it to the baby.”
The 37-year-old Baldwin, Long Island woman started experiencing coronavirus symptoms two days into her March 9 medical leave for unrelated pregnancy complications, according to workers compensation claim records.
Lab tests from March 24 later confirmed that she had COVID-19, according to the claim documents.
“I was really really sick,” Melong, a registered nurse, told The Post.
Melong, who is pregnant with her first child, also had to live with the burden that she unwittingly passed the virus along to other family members one of whom needed to be hospitalized.
“I felt guilty,” Melong said of her family. “They end up getting infected as well when they are doing their best to care for you.”
During Melong’s two-week battle with the virus she experienced a cough, the chills, trouble breathing, loss of hearing, smell and taste and she didn’t feel her baby move for a full 24 hours at one point, the workers’ comp claim says.
Melong used all of her sick and vacation days for the first month, and now she isn’t getting paid.
“My workplace, they are refusing to take responsibility and they don’t have my back at all,” Melong said.
Wyckoff Heights “did not believe that she had contracted [COVID-19] at the hospital since she was on medical leave of absence already,” the workers’ comp papers say adding that her last shift was on March 4.
Melong said that while she didn’t personally tend to the hospital’s first coronavirus case she was around residents who did and who later tested positive.
Melong said she and her family have since recovered from the virus and from what doctors can see the fetus is healthy.
Still, “[t]here is no way of seeing if the virus has been transmitted to the fetus,” she said.
Meanwhile, the hospital wants her to work again and told her she will lose her health insurance if she doesn’t return.
Her lawyer said the hospital has denied her workers’ compensation claim which now must be litigated.
Returning to work is out of the question, according to her physician, Dr. Charles Edwards Robins.
“I think she absolutely should not go back to work. She does have severe symptoms of PTSD. She has been severely traumatized as a result of this COVID-19 thing,” the trauma psychotherapist told The Post.
“It has had tremendous personal effects in her own life,” Robins said. “She thinks she is to blame now for the hardships of her family.”
The doctor recommended that she attend video therapy sessions twice a week.
”There is a big difference between being essential and expendable,” said Melong’s lawyer Jason Goldfarb of the Goldfarb Law Group. “You can’t pick up a paper or watch the news without hearing how much everybody loves these essential workers, such as Tamekia.
“But then when it comes time to do the right thing they are treating them as merely expendable.”
Wyckoff Heights president and CEO of Ramon Rodriguez told The Post that the hospital wants to help Melong.
“We have a complete difference of opinion with respect to the facts that she alludes to but we are happy to speak with her and to communicate and try to be helpful in any way we can.”
“We look forward to trying to help her anyway we can that’s within the contract that we have with the New York State Nurses Association,” Rodriguez said adding that he wasn’t aware of her workers’ comp claim."

Bush after he urged Americans to dismiss partisanship during the coronavirus pandemic, questioning where the Republican was during the impeachment “hoax.”
Trump’s comments came after The George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas released a three-minute clip on Twitter where the former commander-in-chief reminded Americans “how small our differences are in the face of this shared threat.”
“@PeteHegseth ‘Oh bye the way, I appreciate the message from former President Bush, but where was he during Impeachment calling for putting partisanship aside,” Trump tweeted, citing comments from the “Fox & Friends” host.
“He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!” Trump added.
The Democratic-controlled House last December voted to impeach Trump over a phone call to the Ukrainian president seeking an investigation into Joe Biden, a political rival.
Trump was acquitted in the GOP-controlled Senate in January."

Swiss drugmaker Roche said the new test, which determines whether someone had a past infection, has proven 100% accurate at detecting antibodies in the blood and 99.8% accurate at ruling out the presence of them.
The company said the test requires intravenous blood draws, with higher accuracy than finger-prick tests.
“If you take blood from a finger prick, you will never be able to achieve the same level of specificity that you will achieve … when you take blood from the vein,” said Thomas Schinecker, the company’s head of diagnostics.
“You have to have very, very high specificity. Even 0.1% or 0.2% makes a difference.”
Schinecker said the tests are an important step in determining whether someone may have immunity, but acknowledged that more research is required to determine whether antibodies protect people from being reinfected.
“Since this virus is not well known, one can hypothesize, but the proof will take longer,” Schinecker said. “Testing these people … is key to seeing whether or not people really have developed immunity.”

302,Man arrested 3 times in a day released each time over coronavirus fears,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/man-arrested-3-times-in-a-day-released-over-coronavirus-fears/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
A man in California was arrested three times over the course of 12 hours on Wednesday — including for allegedly leading officers on a pursuit — and was only given citations and released each time due to the statewide zero-bail policy amid the coronavirus outbreak, according to officials.
The Glendora Police Department said Friday on Facebook that 24-year-old Dijon Landrum from Monterey Park racked up three citations between 8:28 a.m. and 8:50 p.m. on Wednesday after three incidents in the city located about 23 miles east of Los Angeles.
“We want to thank all of the citizens that helped with this investigation, particularly those that called when they noticed something suspicious,” police said.
According to police, the first incident happened around 8:28 a.m. when officers responding to a call of a man who was attempting to break into a vehicle on the 1400 block of South Grand Avenue.
When officers arrived at the scene, they contacted Landrum, who was attempting to drive away in a stolen vehicle from the East Los Angeles area. In addition to driving a stolen vehicle, police said the 24-year-old had stolen property and narcotics with him.
“Landrum was arrested,” police said. “Due to the California Zero-Bail Policy, he was issued a citation and released.”
One hour after Landrum was released, officers received a call around 2:20 p.m. of an unknown man carrying a box and walking through the front yards of homes.
“It appeared that the male was placing items in this box as he was walking through the properties,” police said.
When officers arrived on the scene, they encountered Landrum for the second time, reportedly with a box of stolen property. He was issued a second citation and released.
Several hours later around 8:50 p.m., officers received a call of a vehicle that had been stolen out of a parking lot on the 1300 block of South Grand Avenue.
Officers tracked the vehicle and located it heading along the westbound 100 freeway in La Puente, with assistance from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office and California Highway Patrol.
A pursuit eventually ended in Pasadena, where Landrum was once again arrested, this time for allegedly being in possession of a stolen vehicle and for evading officers.
“Due to the California Zero-Bail Policy, Landrum was released with his third citation of the day,” police said.
The zero-cash bail emergency mandate in California, which has lead to reduced prison populations to reduce the spread of COVID-19, is continuing to be a challenge for law enforcement as alleged criminals are released back into the public, according to FOX11.
Last weekend, a man in Chino Hills was arrested four times over the course of two days for allegedly trespassing on the same property, only to be released due to the zero cash bail policy.
Cindy Bachman, the Public Information Officer for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, said Saturday there have been complaints from the community about the new mandate.
“We hear from people and they’re disappointed that someone can commit a crime and they go to jail, we go through the whole process with them and book them for the crime because there is probable cause to do that, and then because of this order, they’re released,” Bachman told FOX11. “People are disappointed, they’re angry, but this is an order. We have to follow it, but we don’t have to be happy about it.”
As the coronavirus pandemic has worsened, concern shifted to crowded prisons in some communities, where inmates not only live in close proximity to one another, but share laundries, baths and communal eating areas.
The United States has 2.3 million inmates in about 5,000 jails and prisons across the country — believed to be the largest prison population in the world. According to the Bureau of Justice, nearly 200,000 people 55 and older are behind bars.
Officials in California, for instance, responded by releasing thousands of non-violent inmates to open up space in facilities to prevent the spread of the virus.
Orange County, Calif., District Attorney Todd Spitzer told “Fox & Friends Weekend” on Saturday he was “outraged” after the state ordered the release of seven high-risk sex offenders from the county’s jails over concerns they could contract coronavirus.
“We’ve all been told that during the pandemic we needed to release people early, you know, with less than 30 days on their sentence and things like that because of the underlying health pandemic and the fact that we needed to exercise social distancing within the custodial facilities,” he said Saturday. “However, as you know, in the United States today there is a social justice agenda to end bail for those who are incarcerated and this has gone too far.”
There are 13 exceptions for the zero-cash bail emergency mandate for serious offenses, but child abuse is not one of them.
As of mid-April, over 16,000 inmates had been released nationwide, due to the virus.
There were 53,655 cases of COVID-19 in California as of Sunday, with at least 2,194 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University."

“In parks specifically yesterday, we issued 43 summonses,” Shea said Sunday in a joint press briefing with Mayor Bill de Blasio.
An additional eight summonses were issued outside of parks for a total of 51, said Shea, who noted that while “not every single one” of the write-ups was for failing to maintain a social distance “the majority were.”
Three arrests were made citywide, the top cop continued, though he didn’t specify the exact circumstances.
The flurry of summonses notwithstanding, both de Blasio and Shea stressed that most city dwellers are doing their part by keeping a wide berth.
“The vast majority of New Yorkers are following the rules,” said de Blasio.
Added Shea, “I would just reiterate that we had tens of thousands of interactions with people all across the city yesterday, most of them without having to issue any type of enforcement activity, whether it’s a summons or arrest.
“New Yorkers are exhibiting extreme patience for the last few months. We’re going to ask for a little more of it.”"
304,Larry Kudlow won’t ‘rule out’ another coronavirus stimulus package,https://nypost.com/2020/05/03/larry-kudlow-wont-rule-out-another-coronavirus-stimulus-package/,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday he wouldn’t “rule out” another stimulus package, but added that the Trump administration hasn’t made a decision yet.
“We know the economy is still in a terrible, contractionary phase, tremendous hardships everywhere,” Kudlow said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We’re trying to work through this. I don’t want to rule in or out anything right now. We are in discussions internally and with leading members of Congress.”
Host Jake Tapper questioned why the White House put a pause on another round of stimulus funding in light of how quickly the second round of loans to small businesses have been used up, asking if that suggests “there is a real need.”
“It may be,” Kudlow answered. “We haven’t made a decision yet … This has been an extremely popular and effective program. No question about it. Keeping folks on the payroll is so important.”
He went on to say that the funds will “add potential strong springback” as the states phase in reopenings of their economies this summer.
“So I don’t want to rule it out. I think we waited a little too long when the last tranche ran out. Let’s not make the same mistake again,” he said.
Governors have called on Congress to approve another round of funding to provide aid to states that have seen their revenues plummet as businesses close because of the coronavirus, and their expenses rise to combat the outbreak and treat those infected.
More than 30 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks.
The original $2.2 trillion stimulus package passed in March included $349 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, but that cash dried up rapidly because of overwhelming demand.
Congress passed another round of funding last week, and so far $175 billion of the $310 billion authorized has already been distributed."

Dr. Deborah Birx said protesters who gather without wearing masks and not practicing social distancing at rallies against states’ lockdown regulations are “devastatingly worrisome” because they could spread the coronavirus to at-risk family members.
Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, was asked by host Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” about crowds that gathered at Michigan’s state capitol from a “public health standpoint.”
“It’s devastatingly worrisome to me personally because if they go home and, in fact, their grandmother or their grandfather who has a co-morbid condition and they have a serious or a very or an unfortunate outcome, they will feel guilty for the rest of our lives,” she responded. “So we need to protect each other at the same time we’re voicing our discontent.”
Demonstrations against governors’ stay-at-home orders have ramped up in the past weeks as the economic effects caused by the pandemic worsen and more Americans apply for unemployment benefits.
Crowds of protesters — many carrying guns — showed up at the statehouse in Michigan on Thursday. President Trump last week called on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to “make a deal” with the protesters.
Other pockets of unrest broke out in Wisconsin, Arizona and California.
Birx was also asked about whether it was safe for businesses like nail salons, gyms and spas to reopen in states that have loosened lockdown restrictions.
She said it was safer if both parties wore masks, “but we’ve made it clear that that is not a good phase one activity, and I think the president’s made that clear when he discussed the case in Georgia.”
President Trump last month said he disagreed “strongly” with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to begin reopening businesses before meeting the criteria set out for phase one openings.
The guidelines for phase one require a state to show that the number of coronavirus cases has been declining for 14 straight days.
No state has yet met that qualification."

Don’t be a coronavirus knucklehead!
New Jersey officials have launched a new campaign to try to shame locals into social distancing — saying curbing idiotic behavior is the only way it will finally end its coronavirus lockdown.
“DON’T BE A KNUCKLEHEAD. KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE,” warn new signs on highways, as shown in a short video tweeted by Gov. Phil Murphy.
Murphy used the same term at a press briefing Saturday, saying that the only way the Garden State can ever fully re-open is curbing the “knucklehead” behavior of people refusing to social distance, which only heightens the spread.
“The family, friends and neighbors who we have lost are the reason why we can’t rush our restart,” Murphy said, according to Bloomberg.
“If we are reckless we will lose not just more, but many more beyond that.”
The state — second only to New York for coronavirus cases and deaths — allowed state parks and golf courses to re-open Saturday for the first time since early April.
“If we hear reports of people not taking either their health or … the health of other park-goers seriously then we won’t hesitate to — and I don’t say this with any joy — to close them again,” Murphy said. “If we can do this, and I know we can, then we will be able to move forward.”
But his attention-grabbing term has riled up critics who accuse him of demeaning the state’s residents.
“The sophomoric language is unbecoming of the Governor, and certainly not fair to the people of New Jersey,” Sen. Joe Pennacchio said in a statement, saying he “strongly” condemned the “disrespectful” term.
“Webster defines a knucklehead as a ‘stupid person.’ Is that what you think of sacrificing New Jersey citizens? Really?”
New Jersey has had 7,742 deaths from Covid-19, Murphy said, and total confirmed cases were at 123,717 as of Saturday."

Michigan has the highest death rate in the US from those getting coronavirus — as the state continues to be divided by bitter protests over strict stay-at-home orders, data shows.
While it has far fewer overall cases than either New York or New Jersey, the Wolverine State had seen more than 4,000 deaths as of Saturday — a fatality rate of 9.13 percent, according to WWMT.
That puts it a full percentage point higher than the second-worst state — Connecticut — and far worse than most of the rest of the US, where the fatality rate for those infected is 5.88 percent, the site said.
Most of the fatal cases appear to be centered in poverty-stricken areas of Detroit, according to the data — with surrounding counties accounting for at least 70% of cases, and 81% of deaths, according to the data.
The startling figures come as the state continues to be divided by some of the most bitter protests against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s lockdown after declaring a state of emergency.
Last week, hundreds of angry demonstrators — some armed with rifles — stormed the State House, terrifying lawmakers who wore bulletproof vests to protect themselves."

“In the final analysis, we are not partisan combatants. We are human beings, equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of God. We rise or fall together.”
Bush noted that he had seen America join to “embrace unavoidable new duties” after the 9/11 attacks, and sees that spirit still alive and well today.
“In the days to come, it will be especially important to care in practical ways for the elderly, the ill and the unemployed,” he said."

Lawrence Garbuz — who was revealed on March 2 to be the first known carrier in New Rochelle, where the contagion quickly spread — spoke out about his ordeal for the first time in a sit-down that aired Monday on NBC News’ “Today.”
“I just thought it was a cough. A winter cough and quite frankly, I’m not certain that any of the sort of medical staff had been thinking about that initially when they examined me,” Garbuz, 50, told Savannah Guthrie, with his wife, Adina, by his side.
Asked whether the virus came up during his first visit to the doctor, Garbuz said: “Not at all. There was no mention of it at all.”
He added: “I’m a lawyer. I sit at a desk all day. I think at the time we were sort of focusing on individuals who had maybe traveled internationally, something that I had not done.”
The attorney was the second person in the state revealed to have tested positive for COVID-19. He was released from the hospital in late March.
His wife said they initially thought he had pneumonia, but he just kept getting “worse and worse.”
“Healthy, vibrant person, all of a sudden overnight gets so sick so quickly. I know that at this point, we’re not so surprised by that. But at that time, it was shocking,” Adina said.
When she found out her husband had contracted COVID-19, she said she was “on the phone through the night with various departments of health finding out what to do, and sharing everywhere we went,” adding, “I didn’t want anybody else to get sick.”
Eventually, she decided to transfer her husband to a larger hospital in Manhattan.
“I just didn’t think he was gonna make an ambulance ride,” said Adina, who made sure her husband was intubated for the ambulance ride to help him breathe.
At one point during his illness, Garbuz had to be placed in a medically induced coma, sources previously told The Post.
“My wife saved my life,” Lawrence said. “After we entered the emergency room, I have absolutely no recollection of anything that transpired until I woke up from the coma.”
The dad of four, who rode the Metro-North train to get to his boutique Manhattan law firm, likely contracted the illness locally.
It quickly spread among dozens in his community — which became the first coronavirus hotspot in the country, prompting Gov. Andrew Cuomo to establish a mile-radius “containment zone” centered on the family’s synagogue.
At least 1,341 people in Westchester County have succumbed to the virus, according to state data. At the height of the outbreak, the county was reporting 30 to 40 deaths a day.
More than 31,000 people there have been infected.
“I really have not focused on any of the media frenzy in terms of one of the first patients to get it,” Lawrence said in the interview. “But I have been focused more on, as I say, getting better.”
For Ella Garbuz, one of their kids, having their dad home has been a blessing.
“This is just like a miracle for all of us,” she said."

Customers at Cookies & Creme in Castle Rock — some of whom waited two hours to be seated — were also packed together closer than the recommended six feet distance, according to a video shot by Nick Puckett of Colorado Community Media.
The owner of the restaurant, April Arelleno, welcomed the crowd and thanked her supporters in a video statement to news station CBS4.
But under Colorado’s safer-at-home order, restaurants are only permitted to offer delivery or take-out services.
The decision to open on Mother’s Day didn’t sit well with the local health department.
“We are disappointed that Cookies and Crème has decided to ignore the Governor’s Safer at Home order and open up today with no attention to social distancing,” the Tri-County Health Department said in a statement to CBS4.
“As the entity charged with enforcing the Governor’s statewide Safer at Home Public Health Order, we will follow up with this restaurant to ensure that they, like other restaurants in the county, take appropriate steps to protect the public health, by limiting service to curbside and take-out service.”
The restaurant did “what the government isn’t doing — opening,” a manager told the news station, who called the customers “patriots.”"

Fast-forward to now. A couple of days ago, I got a call from a dear friend who has been a quadriplegic for more than 30 years, ever since he broke his neck while on vacation. He has lived a remarkably rich life since, focused mainly on helping others. As the conversation ended, he said, “You know, right now, the whole world is finding out what it means to be a little bit paralyzed.”
His insight struck a chord, and I answered, “They’re finding out what it’s like to have a little bit of cancer.” For many others, these days were familiar before the pandemic; we knew this life.
Due to the pandemic, some people are sick, some are dying and all of us are without access to many of the things we used to take for granted. Many times a day, I hear otherwise intelligent people saying, “I can’t do this anymore; I can’t live like this.” But the cringe-inducing trigger for me is, “I can’t believe this is happening.” What they really mean is, “I can’t believe this is happening to me.”
We are social animals, with two categories of need. One is physical: water, food, sleep. The other is human connection: conversation, stimulation, engagement. It is those things that are the most devastating to lose during a period of isolation. And that is what we are in right now, a period of isolation.
With each passing day, scientists are bringing us closer to successful therapies and strategies. For most of us, this time will end. But not for all.
Some children will go for months or years without seeing a military parent serving overseas. Some adults and children will continue to navigate their lives wheelchair-bound. Many elderly will remain alone, hoping for a phone to ring so they can use their voice at least once a day.
Here is my wish. I wish when this is all over, we might grow out of the ritual use of such words as community, belonging and connection. Simply telling someone that she is a member of a community is downright hurtful if you don’t actually reach out to her; telling someone that he belongs is worse than meaningless if you do nothing to make him feel that way. Telling a family you feel a connection with their normal — new or old — does nothing to improve their situation.
Our schools are among the worst offenders. They say they aspire to produce students who are “global citizens” and perform “acts of kindness,” yet it has taken a global pandemic for them to feebly organize distance learning — and begin to look at social interaction for students who can’t physically be in the classroom even absent a pandemic.
Such initiatives should have been considered long ago. With a few heroic exceptions, many schools are virtually abandoning their students.
We should take an oath that after COVID-19 has passed, we will be among those who don’t wait to be asked before they visit an elderly neighbor, drop off a meal or balloons for a first responder or simply send a text or make a telephone call when someone is ill. When our lives return to normal, let’s remember those for whom this isn’t temporary. We are all in this together now; let’s stop vacuously using words like community and belonging and instead reach out in a concrete way.
Isolation and difficult days will end, soon, for most — but not for all.

313,Gov. Cuomo admits he was wrong to order nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/cuomo-was-wrong-to-order-nursing-homes-to-accept-coronavirus-patients/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo has finally admitted — tacitly and partially, anyway — the mistake that was state health chief Howard Zucker’s order that nursing homes must admit coronavirus-positive patients.
On Sunday, Cuomo announced a new regulation: Such patients must now test negative for the virus before hospitals can return them to nursing homes. Yet the gov also admitted that COVID-19 cases might still go to the facilities via other routes, and didn’t explicitly overrule Zucker’s March 25 mandate that homes must accept people despite their testing status — indeed, couldn’t even require a test pre-admission.
The gov’s people say that a home that simply can’t accommodate coronavirus patients never had to take them — though they are obliged to help those people find a place that will, with help available from the state if needed. That is: Zucker’s mandate was never more than a “don’t discriminate” rule.
But Zucker publicly presented it as “must accept” — and Cuomo’s remarks regularly implied there must be something wrong with a home that couldn’t handle corona patients.
So, while the gov’s people imply that some homes simply misunderstood the rules, the real message to operators was that declaring themselves overwhelmed would put their licenses at risk.
Notably, the chief of one Cobble Hill facility not only had his request for PPE denied, he got turned down cold when he then asked to transfer patients.
Then, too, Zucker’s Department of Health has issued other heartless orders during this crisis — the now-rescinded “don’t even try to resuscitate” mandate to EMTs for cardiac-arrest cases, as well as telling at least one home it was OK to keep staffers on the job after they’d tested positive.
Also telling: The gov has ordered an investigation that’s plainly supposed to pin all the blame on nursing and adult-care facilities: It’s led by state Attorney General Tish James, who got her job with Cuomo’s crucial assistance — and it’s only looking at what homes did wrong.
We’re sure James will uncover plenty of real horrors: Everyone (who cared to know) has long been aware that many New York nursing homes leave a lot to be desired. But that was all the more reason for Zucker & Co. to focus on policing and assisting these facilities from the start — rather than issuing edicts that led to repeated and needless tragedies."
314,Less than 1 percent of MLB employees have coronavirus antibodies,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/less-than-1-percent-of-mlb-employees-have-coronavirus-antibodies/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"A study of 5,754 employees, including a handful of active players, from 27 Major League Baseball teams revealed that about 0.7 percent tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, the doctors heading the study announced Sunday.
The employees, all of whom live in the United States, either received tests from medical personnel at their home ballparks or self-administered tests in their homes.
Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University who ran the study, said in a telephone news conference on Sunday that the results serve as “a really important peek into the public health consequences of COVID-19 and also the nature of the disease. What we learned from this study, nationwide, is that the range of clinical presentations include a substantial number of people who are infected with the disease but have very few symptoms and don’t proceed to the viral pneumonia we see.
“This helps doctors and health officials … provide a more complete picture of how people when they’re infected will respond. It’s sometimes a very deadly disease, but most often asymptomatic or mild, especially in this relatively healthy population.”
What it doesn’t do, Bhattacharya and his partners made clear, is present any sort of roadmap for whether or how baseball can return to action before a vaccine has been developed and distributed.
“The study wasn’t designed to bring baseball back,” said Daniel Eichner, the president of the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory, who partnered with Bhattacharya. Rather, it exemplified baseball’s willingness to help learn more about coronavirus.
“I think this gives us insight into how this disease is affecting a relatively healthy working-age population, and it also gives us a clear picture of some of the variation across the country,” said Bianca Mulaney, a medical student at Stanford. “Thirdly, it also highlights the challenges of using testing when there is such a low prevalence to begin with, in terms of for policy.”
About 70 percent of those who tested positive had been asymptomatic, the doctors said. Based on the participants’ locations — some were staying at home far from their employers’ locale — they tested lower than the occupants of their surrounding communities, an endorsement of the practices that teams utilized before the sport shut down on March 12."
315,Coronavirus has likely killed over 5 percent of NY nursing home residents,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/coronavirus-has-killed-more-than-5-of-ny-nursing-home-residents/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"The coronavirus has likely already killed more than 5 percent of the state’s nursing-home population, according to the latest figures from New York’s Health Department.
As of the start of Sunday, there were 2,598 confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the facilities statewide, the DOH said. There also were 2,646 fatal presumed coronavirus cases in New York nursing homes, in which the deceased weren’t officially tested but displayed telltale symptoms of the contagion.
Both figures total 5,244 deaths, or nearly 5.2 percent of the state’s nursing-home population of 101,518.
And that percentage doesn’t even include the nursing-home residents who were transferred to other facilities, such as hospitals, and died from COVID-19.
Cuomo noted Sunday that 12 percent of the state’s confirmed virus fatalities occurred in nursing homes, with 33 other states having higher rates of nursing-home death — though that does not count suspected cases. He insisted New York’s position was a feat, given how vulnerable the population is to the pandemic.
“Whatever we’re doing has worked,” he said."

“Vice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,” said spokesman Devin O’Malley. “Additionally, Vice President Pence has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow.”
Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for the virus Friday, the same week that one of Trump’s valets did, too.

Andrew Cuomo over business closures,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/long-island-strip-club-owner-sues-gov-cuomo-over-business-closures/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"The owner of a Long Island jiggle joint was stripped of his constitutional right to put skin on display thanks to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s coronavirus shutdown, a new lawsuit claims.
Sean McCarthy, who’s run the Blush Gentleman’s Club in Commack since 1997, filed suit against Cuomo over his executive orders shuttering non-essential businesses amid the pandemic.
“Governor Cuomo is engaged in a huge overstep of executive power,” said Joe Murray, an attorney for McCarthy. “He is infringing on people’s fundamental civil rights far beyond the least restrictive means allowable under the constitution.
“Someone should remind him he is the governor and not the king.”
The governor’s orders “constituted a breach of constitutional duty” and have caused McCarthy “immediate and irreparable harm and actual and undue hardship,” claims the federal lawsuit, filed Saturday by Murray and Peter Crusco in the Eastern District of New York.
The nudie bar boss says his business can run safely through social distancing and “strict hygiene” by staff, but that the orders “do not even permit the attempt to do so.”
McCarthy is also taking the feds and the Small Business Administration to court for denying his and other strip clubs funds from the federal coronavirus stimulus bill.
Sex-related businesses are not eligible for loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, depriving McCarthy of “the most effective way to continue [his] business and exercise [his] right to free speech,” according to the filing.
“In times of crises such as these, it is particularly discriminatory in that certain businesses will continue and others who deal with subjects the Government does not favor… will be dealt the hand of business death, aces and eights,” the documents state.
McCarthy is requesting a jury trial and at least $150,000 in damages and attorneys costs and fees.
“This executive authority was passed by the legislature and, as we were able to bend the curve and upend the models showing even higher hospitalizations and deaths, it was necessary to fight this ‎pandemic,” said Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi.
“But this is clearly the most New York Post story ever and I acknowledge that,” he added.
The SBA didn’t comment."

“I think that I’d be a lot safer if I was sitting at home than I would be going to the West Wing,” Kevin Hassett, a senior adviser to President Trump, told CBS TV’s “Face the Nation.” “But you know, it’s a time when people have to step up and serve their country.”
Last week, the press secretary for Vice President Mike Pence, as well as one of President Trump’s valets, tested positive for the contagion.
“It is scary to go to work” Hassett said. “You know the West Wing, it’s a small, crowded place. it’s a little bit risky, but you have to do it.
“There’s a lot of things that you can’t do except there, like if you’re going to have secure communications.”
He added, “That’s why the doctors are so careful about testing everyone every day.”"

Dr. Ethan Weiss, a University of San Francisco cardiologist, shared a photo Saturday of nearly every seat full on the plane out of Newark Airport in New Jersey.
“I guess @united is relaxing their social distancing policy these days? Every seat full on this 737,” Weiss wrote.
There were many passengers on board who were “scared” and “shocked” by the airline’s lack of social distancing measures, he said.
“They could have avoided this by just communicating better,” Weiss wrote of the airline. “They literally just sent an email 10 days ago telling all of us the middle seats would be empty.”
Weiss said he was traveling with around 25 other nurses and doctors who have been volunteering on the frontlines of Big Apple hospitals for the past few weeks.
He noted that he previously praised the airline for flying medical workers there for free, but said the nightmare return trip was the “last time I’ll be flying again for a very long time.”
Just days before flying, he had told ABC7: “I’m scared of getting on the airplane on Saturday. I’ve been taking care of COVID-19 patients for the last two weeks, and I’m more scared of getting on the airplane on Saturday than I’m walking into the hospital.”
Another physician returning home, Dr. Rebecca Palvin, also blasted the airline for not doing more to protect travelers.
“Hey @United: I appreciate you getting us home from New York, but I’d prefer there be some level of #socialdistancing,” she wrote.
The airline responded to the frontline workers’ complaints in a statement, saying it can no longer guarantee all customers will be booked next to an empty seat.
“Last month, we began limiting advanced seat selection for adjacent seats in all cabins, including middle seats where available and alternating window and aisle seats when seats are in pairs,” the company said in a statement to ABC7.
“Though we cannot guarantee that all customers will be seated next to an unoccupied seat, based on historically low travel demand and the implementation of our various social distancing measures that is the likely outcome.”"

This Adirondack resident is as tough as his upstate home’s bedrock granite.
Chris Swiesz is among the nurses from Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital in Plattsburgh near the Canadian border who have been flocking to the city to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
Swiesz, 45, previously only made forays to the city to see the Yankees play or catch a Broadway show. Now, he has been toiling in the emergency room at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital in Inwood, Manhattan, since mid-April.
“I asked my bosses at Chaplain if I can come down to the city to help out. I’m glad to be here,” Swiescz told The Post. “The city was a huge hot spot.”
He said it was clear when he arrived that COVID-19 had taken a heavy toll on the hospital’s staffers.
“A lot of the nurses had gone out sick. They were on 14-day quarantines. Not only are you dealing with all these patients, but your hospital staff was depleted,” Swiesz said of the situation.
He said the hospital’s emergency department has 30 beds, but the ER was overflowing with more than double the patients during the COVID peak.
“You could really tell they were under the gun. They were definitely fighting a battle,” Swiesz said.
Amid all that, Presbyterian took another hit when ER doctor Lorna Breen committed suicide. Her funeral service was live-streamed at the hospital.
“It was a real somber movement,” he said.
Swiesz, who has worked at Chaplain since 2001, including 18 years as ER nurse, said the COVID-19 crisis enveloping the city providing him a personal challenge of “coming out of my comfort zone in the north country.”
“You know the saying. `If you make it here, you can make it anywhere.’ I wanted to see if I can do it in the big city,” he said.
Swiesz wanted to see if he could handle the volume and intensity of working in a big city hospital ER and “getting used to the sickness of the patients.”
But while the worst appears to be over, there are still many sick COVID patients being admitted to the ER, he said.
“They’re coming in with breathing problems. Their oxygen levels are low. They’re pale. We’re seeing patients coming from the nursing homes,” he said. “It’s still in the community. It’s still out there.”
He said it helps that the staff and management at Presbyterian have embraced him like family as part of the larger cause to help treat patients.
“It’s really been great. The staff welcomed me with open arms. They’re just wonderful people,” Swiesz said.

321,Some homeless people avoid shelters amid subway coronavirus cleanings,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/some-homeless-avoid-shelters-amid-subway-coronavirus-cleanings/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"Hundreds of homeless people are leaving the city’s subway system for shelters amid overnight coronavirus cleanings, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday — but whether they stay is another matter.
“Sometimes it literally works the first time when someone comes off the street and they like what they experience in a safe haven of a shelter or they get the medical care they need,” said de Blasio during a press briefing. “And sometimes it’s not as immediate. It takes several rounds, if you will.”
While many of the homeless straphangers — forced to street-level from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. by the now nightly closures — have accepted a helping hand, several others have simply spent the nights riding buses or roughing it on the streets.
Several have expressed fears of contracting the COVID-19 inside densely-packed city shelters, while others have decried the lack of services inside the facilities.
“Now I’m gonna sleep outside,” one man, who gave his name as Rick, told advocacy group Human.nyc outside a shelter he was driven to after being ousted from the 7 train early Friday. “I don’t want to go to the shelters. … There’s no help.”
Overall, de Blasio held up the initiative to reroute homeless from the rails to city facilities as a success.
“We keep seeing something very special happening,” Hizzoner crowed on Sunday.
“This is about changing people’s lives,” continued de Blasio. “In just a matter of days, hundreds upon hundreds of people accepting services, coming into shelter.”
Of 416 homeless engaged by NYPD cops and city social workers on Friday night, 212 agreed to enter either a shelter or hospital — while 198 of 384 engaged the next night accepted a helping hand, de Blasio said.
But de Blasio and Steven Banks, the besieged commissioner of the city’s Human Resources Administration, conceded that some homeless go no further than the shelter door.
“I would expect if you’re talking about the last few nights, you’re going to see a mix,” said de Blasio. “You’re going to see people who came in for one night, you’re going to see people who have stayed in longer, you’re going to see people who will, some cases, go back to the streets over time, others who we’re going to keep in permanently.
“But it’s all going to be about persistence.”
Banks added that after seeing some walk away overnight Thursday into Friday, outreach workers changed course by bringing the homeless directly to shelters, rather than the central intake facility.
“We began to do that on Saturday morning and this morning,” said Banks. “And we think that is giving an additional helping hand to those who may be ready to take the hand but not yet ready to go all the way with that helping hand.”"
322,Coronavirus meat shortages could potentially last through summer,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/coronavirus-meat-shortages-could-last-through-summer/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Meat lovers, get ready for a hangry summer.
Meat shortages that have been plaguing consumers since the start of the pandemic are expected to last for months — potentially through the summer-grilling season — as meat processors struggle to reopen at full capacity in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, The Post has learned.
While burger chain Wendy’s has insisted the shortages that hit an estimated one in 20 of its stores last week are “temporary,” meat distributors, grocery owners and other restaurateurs say they expect a limited supply of beef, pork and chicken to last well beyond the Fourth of July. And whatever meat is available will likely cost more than before.
“We talk about this lasting until July or through August. It’ll be a tough summer,” said Vincent Pacifico, president of Vista Food Exchange, one of the largest meat wholesalers at the Hunts Point Cooperative Market in the Bronx. “You can’t force people back to work if they are sick and scared,” Pacifico explained of the shortages.
Indeed, some of the largest slaughterhouses and meat-packing plants are having trouble ramping up due to labor shortages despite the White House intervening last month to keep production going at facilities run by Tyson Foods and Smithfield Foods, sources said.
On April 28, President Trump signed an executive order shielding plants from forced closures by state governors. But facilities owned by big operators like Tyson, Cargill, Smithfield Foods and JBS USA Holdings have shuttered nonetheless as the spread of the virus has crippled production.
Some 5,000 meat-processing workers have contracted COVID-19 and 20 have died, according to labor groups.
Slaughterhouses that have reopened, meanwhile, are only operating at about 30 to 40 percent of their capacity, industry experts said. Meatpackers are “slowly getting their people back to work, putting in partitions and spreading the workers out along the line, but their productivity won’t be the same,” said Richard Romanoff, chief executive of Nebraskaland, a Bronx-based meat wholesaler.
The bottlenecks are even affecting smaller food operations, like FarmersCart, which ships organic beef, chicken and prepared meals direct to consumers from its Staunton, Va., farm. Despite having sold out of a year’s worth of its free-range chicken in just four weeks in March and April, the farm isn’t planning to replenish its flock due to a backlog at the facility that cuts up its chicken, said co-owner Tai Lopez.
“Chicken is becoming impossible for us, because it requires more complex processing than beef and pork,” said Lopez, who hopes to start offering it again in July.
Romanoff also sees supply continuing to be tight through July and has been sourcing more products from overseas as a result, including from Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Nicaragua. “It’s the first time I’ve bought meat from Nicaragua,” he said.
Similarly, Morton Williams Supermarkets, which has 14 stores in Manhattan, on Friday told customers its stores are “fully stocked” and “not imposing limits” on meat purchases — thanks to its meat and seafood director Victor Colello having “forged relationships with multiple suppliers —large and small.”
Those supply bottlenecks don’t come without a price, though. The grocery chain has absorbed seven increases over the past two weeks, resulting in higher prices for consumers. Steaks now cost $18.99 a pound, up from $14.99 two weeks ago, while pork prices are up $2 to $6.99 a pound, according to Colello.
A reliance on smaller meat suppliers also has helped Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Fat Brands avoid shortages at its 375 eateries, including Fatburger, Bonanza Steakhouse and Ponderosa Steakhouse, said Chief Executive Andy Wiederhorn. But the price volatility could see Fat Brands raise its $6-to-$7 burgers by $1 this summer. “I think this problem will last until the fall,” he said.
Now, with restaurants reopening in nearly half the country, distributors like Pacifico — who’s been paying twice as much for beef since COVID-19 — see supplies becoming even tighter, which will further drive up prices and potentially result in more sporadic outages like those at Wendy’s.
The extent of the hikes and shortages also will depend on how successful restaurants are at their planned reopenings, including Wiederhorn’s all-you-can-eat buffet steakhouses in the Midwest.
“We are going from buffet to table service,” Wiederhorn said. “But I can’t tell you today how much steak I can order because I don’t know who wants to come out to eat.”"
323,Beef quality upped at grocery stores during coronavirus pandemic,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/beef-quality-upped-at-grocery-stories-during-coronavirus-pandemic/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"If home-cooked burgers seem to taste better than usual lately, it’s not just because they’re harder to get.
As the pandemic spurs meat shortages nationwide, the ground beef at many supermarkets is quietly getting upgraded with better cuts that would normally go to restaurants, industry experts said.
While ground chuck, round and sirloin is typically made with leftover trimmings, much of the packaged burger meat turning up on shelves in recent weeks is also cut with the premium stuff: brisket, chuck steak and short ribs.
“A burger maker [or supermarket] is going to buy anything they can grind into chopped meat and we are starting to see that happen,” Gary Morrison, vice president of UrnerBarry, a price reporting agency for the meat industry, told The Post.
That’s because sit-down restaurants that typically buy those better cuts have been shut down nationwide amid state ordered lockdowns, according to Andy Wiederhorn, chief executive of Fat Brands, a Beverly Hills, Calif.-based franchisor for 375 eateries including Fatburger, Bonanza Steakhouse and Ponderosa Steakhouse.
“The burgers will get better for a few weeks, because there is a glut of prime meat,” Wiederhorn said.
Upscale restaurants in the Big Apple like Minetta Tavern in Greenwich Village offer a $33 “Black Label Burger” with “a selection of prime dry-aged cuts,” according to its menu.
While those goodies are sure to be found at corner grocers in the coming weeks, the catch is that there will be no way to tell exactly what you’re getting, says Richard Romanoff, chief executive of Nebraskaland, a meat wholesaler in the Bronx.
“People have no idea what’s in their chuck meat anyway,” Romanoff said, adding that supermarket packages simply say 100 percent beef rather than the type of cut."
324,Nonprofit ensures NYC Holocaust survivors are fed amid coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/nonprofit-feeds-nyc-holocaust-survivors-amid-coronavirus/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
More than a thousand Holocaust survivors in the Big Apple have been kept well fed during the coronavirus pandemic thanks to a $1 million grocery delivery program quietly rolled out by The Met Council.
“Right now, my lifesaver is what I get from the boxes,” 90-year-old survivor Lena Goren, who lives in Queens, told The Post. “The food coming here helps me a great deal.”
The charity — which is officially called the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty — first launched the grocery delivery program as a pilot shortly before Passover this year and kicked it into high gear in mid-April as the COVID-19 crisis forced seniors into isolation.
The program served 3,076 New Yorkers during a recent week and a third of those who received food — 1,112 — are members of New York’s community of Holocaust survivors.
Goren — who was born in Greece and hid from the Nazis with her family at a monastery after their town mayor warned her rabbi father they were set for deportation — said the weekly box of groceries means, “I can cook at any time of the day.”
Each weekly food box contains a pound of fruit and a pound of veggies, canned beans, tuna, rice, pasta, cereal, milk, granola bars and other items, according to David Greenfield, the nonprofit’s chief executive.
“It’s literally a matter of life and death,” he said. “We can’t tell people who are sick and elderly to go leave their homes and wait on line for hours just so they can get some food.”
The Met Council spends about $165,000 a week on the program, which Greenfield said has been underwritten largely by a $500,000 donation from real estate mogul Jane Goldman. All told, the charity has raised $1.2 million to support the effort.
Greenfield said the program is open to homebound seniors of all faiths. Those interested in applying should email food(at)metcouncil.org."
325,85 NY kids stricken with mysterious coronavirus-linked disease: Cuomo,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/85-ny-kids-stricken-with-mysterious-coronavirus-linked-disease/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"New York has now seen at least 85 children stricken by a new coronavirus-linked inflammatory syndrome — along with two more possible deaths, Gov. Andrew Cuomo revealed Sunday.
“It is a situation that has taken the lives of three New Yorkers,” Cuomo said of the mysterious sickness that mimics the rare inflammatory condition Kawasaki disease.
“There are two additional deaths that are currently under investigation as possibly related to this same situation,” he revealed at his press briefing Sunday.
The 85 cases were up from the previous tally of 73 statewide.
The Big Apple accounted for at least 38 of them, more than double the previous count of 15 — and with nine other possible cases being tested, Mayor Bill de Blasio also revealed Sunday.
Hizzoner called it “deeply, deeply troubling” that “we’ve actually lost a child to this syndrome” following the death of a 5-year-old boy last Thursday at Mount Sinai’s Kravis Children’s Hospital.
Of the confirmed cases, almost half tested positive for coronavirus at the same time — while 81 percent of the rest had virus antibodies, showing they had previously been exposed, Hizzoner said.
The “new threat” is now a “major priority” for city health officials, de Blasio said.
The other confirmed fatalities are a 7-year old in Westchester and a Suffolk County teenager.
Cuomo said that it has been tricky to detect because it “does not present as a normal COVID case,” by attacking blood vessels and the heart rather than the respiratory system.
“It’s possible that these cases were coming in, and not diagnosed as related to COVID because they don’t appear as COVID,” he conceded.
“It may be possible — and it may even be probable — that this is a situation that exists in other states,” he said, with New York health officials alerting departments across the US of the warning signs."

“We’re just not going to send a person who is positive to a nursing home after a hospital visit,” said Cuomo during an Albany press briefing. “Period.”
The ruling partially overrides a controversial March 25 order that nursing homes cannot deny admission or readmission on the basis of a positive or suspected COVID-19 case.
That policy has been roundly criticized as counterintuitive for forcing coronavirus carriers into nursing homes, even as Cuomo has repeatedly acknowledged that seniors are among those most susceptible to the virus.
“This virus uses nursing homes,” Cuomo said on Sunday. “They are ground zero.”
“It’s a congregation of vulnerable people.”
The governor has argued that the March policy was simply in place to prevent discrimination, and that nursing homes always had not just the right, but the duty to refer COVID-positive patients elsewhere if they couldn’t care for them.
Cuomo continued to defend the policy on Sunday, arguing that only 12 percent of the Empire State’s now 21,478 coronavirus fatalities have come in nursing homes, placing New York 34th out of the 50 states.
“Whatever we’re doing has worked, on the facts,” said Cuomo.
He also noted that the new directive doesn’t prohibit COVID-positive people from being admitted to nursing homes via other avenues.
“This is binding on a hospital, not on a nursing home,” he said. “This will reduce the burden on nursing homes all across the board, because they’re not gonna get any COVID people from a hospital.”
Cuomo additionally mandated on Sunday that all nursing home staff must be tested twice weekly going forward.
“That’s not just a temperature check, that is a diagnostic test,” said Cuomo. “We have the tests available.
“The most vulnerable population deserves the highest level of care.”
Cuomo announced the changes as another 207 statewide deaths were reported in the 24-hour period ending at midnight Sunday.
The grim figure equals the fatalities reported on March 27, reaching a low untouched in over a month.
“Still terribly high,” said Cuomo. “But better.”"
327,‘He’s our miracle patient’: Man recovers from coronavirus after 64 days,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/california-coronavirus-patient-recovers-after-64-days-in-hospital/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
A California “miracle patient” was given an emotional sendoff from the hospital after he spent 64 days battling coronavirus, video shows.
Gregg Garfield was the first coronavirus patient to be admitted to St. Joseph’s Providence Medical Center in Burbank, Calif., after he caught the virus on a ski trip in northern Italy in February, CBS Los Angeles reported.
The virus attacked nearly every vital organ in his body, leaving him on a ventilator for 31 days of his two-month stint, the outlet reported.
“I believe there is a 70 percent or above mortality rate for COVID patients that go on a ventilator,” Dr. Daniel Dea told the outlet. “So for him to survive with a near full recovery is amazing. He’s our miracle patient.”
Garfield walked out of the hospital Friday with help from his girlfriend and sister to raucous applause from hospital staffers.
“These guys in the hospital are unbelievable. This walkthrough of love, it’s just amazing,” he said. “These doctors are the best of the best. I could not have survived anywhere else.”
Amanda Kloots — whose husband, Broadway star Nick Cordero has been fighting coronavirus — also shared a video of Garfield’s sendoff on Instagram, saying that she must have “watched this video maybe 100 times.”
“Each time I get chills and teary-eyed,” she wrote."
328,China pressured WHO to delay global coronavirus warning: report,https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/china-pressured-who-to-delay-global-coronavirus-warning/,2020-05-10 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Chinese President Xi Jinping pressured the director of the World Health Organization in January to hold off on issuing a global warning about the coronavirus outbreak, according to a report in a German newspaper.
The Jan. 21 conversation between Jinping and WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was reported in Der Spiegel, which cited intelligence from Germany’s federal intelligence service, known as the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND).
The report published over the weekend said Xi urged the WHO chief to “delay a global warning” about the pandemic and hold back information on human-to-human transmission of the virus.
The BND estimated that China’s action to conceal information resulted in a loss of four to six weeks in the fight against COVID-19.
The WHO released a statement calling the allegations “unfounded and untrue.”
“Dr. Tedros and President Xi did not speak on January  21 and they have never spoken by phone. Such inaccurate reports distract and detract from WHO’s and the world’s efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic,” the statement read.
The WHO continued to say China confirmed human-to-human transmission to the UN health agency on Jan. 20 and the WHO “publicly declared” two days later that “data collected … suggests that human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan.”
The Chinese foreign ministry, in a 30-page article published on its website, refuted claims in the Der Spiegel article, saying it had responded in a “timely” manner and was “open and transparent” about alerting nations around the world about the outbreak.
It also responded to comments made by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that China misled other countries about the pandemic and claimed the virus began in a lab in the city of Wuhan.
The foreign ministry quoted President Abraham Lincoln in its defense, according to Reuters.
“As Lincoln said, you can fool some of the people all the time and fool all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time,” it said in the article.
Trump has blasted China for holding back critical information about the virus to the world, including failing to accurately report on the number of cases.
He also ripped the WHO for being a “pipe organ” for the Chinese Communist Party.
“They must have known more than they knew,” he told reporters at the White House last month. “We knew things that they didn’t know, and either they didn’t know they didn’t tell us … right now, they’re literally a pipe organ for China, that’s the way I view it.”
The president has frozen the US’ payments to the WHO pending investigations by the intelligence community into the UN agency’s relationship with China.
The first cases of the coronavirus were reported in Wuhan, China, in late December."
329,Ex-Mets manager Art Howe released from hospital amid coronavirus battle,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/ex-mets-manager-art-howe-released-from-hospital-battling-coronavirus/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"HOUSTON — Former major league manager and infielder Art Howe was released from a Houston hospital Sunday after a stay in intensive care because of the coronavirus.
“Relief, back in my own bedroom. It’s just sweet,” the 73-year-old former Mets manager said. “It was a long five days or so. I’m finally feeling a little bit better. Still not able to eat real good, taste buds are giving me a hard time. It’s just nice to be back home and hopefully continue to progress.”
Howe will be isolated at home for another week or two.
Best known as the manager of the “Moneyball” Athletics playoff teams in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Howe confirmed Thursday night he has been dealing with the illness since first feeling symptoms of COVID-19 on May 3. He went to the hospital by ambulance Tuesday.
Howe spent 12 seasons in the majors as a player, primarily at second base and third base. He played for Pittsburgh (1974-75) and Houston (1976-82), but missed the 1983 season with an injury before playing two more years for St. Louis (1984-85). Howe hit .260 with 43 home runs and 293 RBIs. His only postseason homer in three playoff trips came in the 1981 NL Division Series against Los Angeles.
Howe began his big league managerial career with the Astros in 1989 and led them for five seasons.
He took over the A’s in 1996 and managed them for seven years while winning 600 regular-season games and leading Oakland to the playoffs three times. Those teams became known for general manager Billy Beane’s then-unconventional method of using sabermetrics to evaluate players. Author Michael Lewis wrote a bestselling book on the A’s called “Moneyball,” and it was later turned into a film starring Brad Pitt as Beane and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Howe.
Howe was released from his contract with the A’s after the 2002 season and became the manager of the Mets for two seasons. He has a 1,129–1,137 record in the majors."
330,Sen. Ben Sasse blames ‘thugs in China’ for coronavirus in graduation speech,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/sen-sasse-blames-thugs-in-china-for-coronavirus-in-graduation-speech/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"GOP senator Ben Sasse drew sharp criticism from a high school board member over comments he made during a commencement address over the weekend.
The senator delivered the online speech to students at his former high school, Fremont High School in Nebraska, where he blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak, joked about students’ fitness and shared his dislike for psychologists.
An unshaven Sasse, wearing a loosened red tie and white shirt, told students at their future reunions they’d talk about “that time when China started a big global pandemic that created the worst public health crisis in over a century and brought the economy to its knees, and we had to stay home and everybody was hoarding toilet paper.”
Sasse continued, “Nobody knows exactly how we’re going to beat this thing, but you know what, we’re Americans, we’re Nebraskans, we’ve got grit and we’re going to beat this thing.”
The senator also said there will be a “serious reckoning with the thugs in China who let this mess spiral out of control by lying about it.”
He also told the students, “Everybody named Jeremy is the worst,” without any explanation.
He also cited Netflix “Tiger King” documentary, murder hornets, and took a jab at the student’s physique, “Back in the day when we were a lot fitter than you people are, we used to have to climb ropes all the way up to the ceiling of the gym all the time.”
The senator took aim at psychologists as well, saying “95 percent of all gainfully employed psychologists … their job is really just to help people forget high school,” adding, “if you’re headed to college, do not — do not — major in psychology. That part’s not a joke.”
A Fremont school board member, Michael Petersen, called on Sasse to apologize on Facebook, “You deserved better than the graduation remarks from Senator Ben Sasse. The racism, implying that our graduates are fat and lazy, disparaging teachers and attacking the mental health profession are despicable.”
Sasse’s spokesman, James Wegmann, told the Omaha World-Herald on Sunday the senator was joking during the graduation speech and that “It’s ridiculous that some politically addicted folks are complaining about Ben calling out China in a joke.”
Wegmann then continued, “He’s said this for months, because it’s true: The Chinese Communist Party’s coronavirus coverup wasted time that could have contained the spread — those lies cost innocent lives in China and around the world. Pretending graduates are too fragile to hear the truth is silly.”"

New Yorkers of the Jewish faith may be able to celebrate the major holiday of Shavuot in synagogue — albeit in a limited capacity with social distancing — during coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.
The governor said he will likely issue guidance Monday or Tuesday on ceremonies for Memorial Day and Shavuot.
Cuomo was asked about holding limited ceremonies upstate where 15 congregants could participate in a Shavout ceremony –with social distancing — during a press briefing in Albany Sunday.
“Social distance with safeguards. Can we find a way to do a ceremony, a religious ceremony or a ceremony that honors Memorial Day? I think we can,” the governor said.
“We’ll have an answer in the next day or two.”
Shavuot begins at sunset of Thursday, May 28 and ends nightfall Saturday, May 30.
Shavuot marks the time that the Jews were given the Torah on Mount Sinai. It also celebrates the start of the wheat harvest and the end of the barley harvest.
Media with a large following among devout Jews were the first to report on Cuomo’s comments."

A Seattle-area coronavirus testing program backed by billionaire Bill Gates was reportedly halted by the federal government last week due to operating without the proper approval.
The program, called the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network, is a partnership between research groups and the Seattle and King County public health department that uses at-home test kits for coronavirus surveillance and diagnostic purposes, The New York Times reported.
SCAN had been operating with state approval — already testing thousands of samples — but administrators were told by the Food and Drug Administration last week to cease operations.
“Please discontinue patient testing and return of diagnostic results to patients until proper authorization is obtained,” the FDA wrote to the partnership in a memo obtained by the newspaper.
Through the program, which uncovered dozens of previously undetected cases, tests are delivered to both healthy and sick people in an attempt to reach a wider population.
Gates lauded the program in a blog post from last week.
“Not only will it help improve our understanding of the outbreak in Seattle, it will also provide valuable information about the virus for other communities around the world,” Gates wrote, according to the report.
An FDA spokesperson in a statement to The Times, wrote, “We had previously understood that SCAN was being conducted as a surveillance study.”
SCAN is also used to diagnose patients and diagnostic tests have separate federal standards, the report said. The group told The Times they have been communicating with the FDA about the program for about 10 weeks.
“We are actively working to address their questions,” the group told the paper."
333,Golf’s charity return was treat we needed — down to the shorts,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/taylormade-driving-relief-was-treat-we-needed-during-coronavirus/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
It was a welcome sight.
Live sports on television after the coronavirus crisis has robbed us of them for the better part of the past two months.
Live golf seen on TV at Seminole Golf Club, an American treasure that most of the world has never seen because of its exclusivity, tucked into Juno Beach, Fla., an exclusive enclave alongside the Atlantic Ocean.
Until Sunday’s TaylorMade Driving Relief charity skins match to raise millions of dollars for COVID-19 aid, the last professional golf seen on TV was the first round of The Players Championship before the tournament was suddenly canceled on March 12.
That was 66 days ago.
So, the mere sight of Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff playing together was a treat.
That fact that they were playing for a cause — raising a total of $5,503,959 million for COVID-19 relief — was an added bonus.
And the sight of the four stars carrying their own bags — without caddies — and playing in shorts made it all even more cool. It made them look a bit like the rest of us who may have played this weekend in the welcoming warm New York Metro-area weather … minus the combined $155 million in career PGA Tour earnings the four have won.
On paper, the competition looked like a gross mismatch.
McIlroy is ranked No. 1 in the world and has 18 career wins, including four major championships. His partner, Johnson, is a former world No. 1 who has 20 PGA Tour wins, including one major championship.
Fowler has five PGA Tour wins and his partner, Wolff, is in his first year on tour and has one win.
For those scoring at home, that was 38 career wins, including five majors, versus six wins and no majors.
Paul Azinger, one of the NBC color commentators, reported at the beginning of the match that the latest betting line he saw required gamblers to lay out $22 to win $10 if their money was on McIlroy and Johnson.
Celebrate good times.

Fowler, with a birdie barrage in the middle of the round (four in six holes), appeared to be carrying him and Wolff to victory. But a back-nine stretch of halved holes — Nos. 13 through 18 — ended in a $1.1 million carryover. So, the players were sent back to the par-3 17th, playing the up tees at 120 yards in a closest-to-the-pin tiebreaker.
Wolff went first and stuffed a shot fairly close. McIlroy, hitting last, dropped one just inside of Wolff and earned him and Johnson the final $1.1 million. That allowed the favorites to out-earn the underdogs, $1.85 million to $1.15 million in the skins competition. The United Health Group also put up $3 million, and viewers donated more than $1 million.
“I wouldn’t be known for my wedge play,’’ said McIlroy, smiling at the irony of the fact that his wedge play draws the most criticism of his game. “It was an awesome day — all of us out here for a great cause. It was nice to get back onto the golf course and get back to some sort of normalcy.’’
At the end of the day, there were no losers among the four players — regardless of how rusty they looked at times (Johnson, in particular, looked rustiest).
The real winners were the charities the players were competing for — Fowler and Wolff raising money for CDC Foundation and McIlroy and Johnson playing for the American Nurses’ Foundation. Wolff captured both of the long-drive side competitions (Nos. 2 and 14) to raise an added $450,000 in charity money.
“I’m proud to be a part of an event to entertain people at home on a Sunday, but to raise money for people who really need it,’’ McIlroy said.
The NBC broadcast of the unique event featured Mike Tirico anchoring from his home in Michigan, where he welcomed in Bill Murray on an awkward Skype chat and also spoke to President Donald Trump as the players neared the hallway point in the match.
“It’s about time,’’ Trump said of seeing live sports on TV. “It’s a wonderful thing to see. I’m getting a little tired of watching 10-year-old golf tournaments where you know who won. It’s so good to see these great players playing. We want to get sports back. We miss sports in terms of the psyche of our country. We’re getting it back.’’
Not a moment too soon."
334,Bruce Springsteen guitarist Nils Lofgren sues New Jersey nursing home,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/bruce-springsteen-guitarist-nils-lofgren-sues-nj-nursing-home/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"The mother-in-law of the guitarist for Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, contracted the coronavirus at an upscale nursing home in Morris County, New Jersey, according to a lawsuit filed last week.
Rocker Nils Lofgren and his wife Amy moved her mother, Patricia J. Landers, into Brookdale Senior Living in Florham Park where the home had promised the family 24-hour security and a staff trained to deal with residents who have dementia.
Landers, 83, “left unattended escaped” the facility in the middle of the night for hours on April 8, says the lawsuit, and was eventually located by police officers — three miles away, bruised and confused.
After she returned to the facility, the family was told she tested negative for the coronavirus.
A week later, Landers was admitted to a hospital in Montclair, where she tested positive for COVID-19 and was suffering from pneumonia.
Landers is now recovering and has been transferred to another facility.
Brookdale has reported only 10 cases of coronavirus as of Friday, and there have been no reported deaths from the virus, according to the New Jersey Health Department.
Lofgren, 68, who is also a member of Neil Young’s band Crazy Horse, told the New York Times, “Shining a light on this problem is important.”
“This is not to take the light off what has been a very demoralizing, tragic story for my mother-in-law that’s still being written” he said.
The lawsuit “involves every child’s worst nightmare” and comes amid a pandemic overrunning nursing care homes across the state, exposing the weakness in the elder care system.
The facility is accused of negligence, fraud, deceptive trade practices and a violation of a New Jersey state law that protects the rights of nursing home residents.
“It’s a nightmare because 99 percent of most people can’t even afford a lawyer,” Lofgren told the Times. “And they just take it, and their families are decimated by it.”
“It’s unconscionable and immoral and disgusting,” he added. “I hope we can hold them accountable.”"

Out-of-state nurses brought to Manhattan to fight the coronavirus say they found hellish conditions at the city-run adult-care center on Roosevelt Island — from patients with horrific bed sores to feces-smeared walls.
“It was just heartbreaking,” said one of the RNs, a mom of four from Wisconsin who spent about 17 days at the Coler Rehabilitation and Nursing Care Center.
“Patients were in deplorable conditions — very, very dirty, bed sores, terrible odors,’’ the FEMA-contracted nurse, 38, told The Post.
“During my shift, I was placing my initials on the adult diapers. When I would return the next day, the patients would have an additional adult diaper on over the one with my initials on it, saturated urine through both and through the sheets.’’
She and several other nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they tended to coronavirus patients in the facility’s long-term-care section.
The virus-sickened patients were already living at the site when the nurses arrived and not among the COVID-19 sufferers who were ordered sent to the facility by Mayor Bill de Blasio because of a shortage of hospital beds amid the pandemic. The patients brought in from the outside were put in a separate wing of the site that had been closed.
There have been 11 confirmed coronavirus deaths and one presumed fatal case at the center so far, the state Health Department said.
One of the FEMA-contracted nurses, who is from Iowa, described feces-smeared and vermin- and roach-infested areas at the facility — and said she even found cockroaches “on a patient in a vegetative state.
“The conditions at Coler went beyond poor nursing care and crossed clearly into criminal negligence and dependent-adult abuse,’’ the RN told The Post.
The 34-year-old mom said there were “food and feces smeared on patients’ beds, walls, tray tables and curtains,’’ while “basic nursing cares [were] not met, including [patient] turns, diaper changes.’’
The Wisconsin nurse said it would take her “at least three packages [of wipes] for every patient to clean their groin area” because they were so dirty.
“Patients were flinching when doing basic cares, putting their arms up in self-defense due to they were in fear of being hit,” she claimed.
Meanwhile, the “ ‘clean’ med room was infested with mice, and ‘clean’ supplies, medication and food were contaminated with mice feces and urine,” the Iowa nurse added.
“Cleaning services said that because of the pandemic, they can’t keep up. [But] it’s very apparent that this entire place was neglected for cleaning for a very long time, not due to the pandemic.’’
And the nurses said forget about keeping COVID-19 patients properly isolated at the site, which is run by the city’s Health + Hospitals Corp.
“Residents were kept for days in group rooms after found to be COVID-positive,’’ the Iowa nurse said.
The Wisconsin caregiver added, “Immediately following [COVID]-positive patients being removed from a room, they would put a negative COVID patient into that place and did not clean the room that they were removed from.”
The Iowa nurse said a manager for the FEMA-contracted agency she worked for brought their concerns to higher-ups — only to be abruptly taken off the job.
A state DOH rep told The Post that “given nature of the complaints,” an “extensive investigation is under way.”
But HHC denied the nurses’ claims to The Post, saying the facility was last inspected by the state Department of Health in November and “found to be in substantial compliance with federal and state regulations.
“NYC Health + Hospitals provides the highest quality care to our patients, ensuring their health and safety always comes first,’’ it added in a statement.
“Any claims of neglect and abuse are simply false, highly disturbing and do not reflect our standards of care.”
But state Assemblywoman Rebecca Seawright, whose district includes Roosevelt Island, called the nurses’ reports “outrageous and intolerable.
“The New York state Health Department must investigate and require that these reported conditions be immediately resolved and that patients at risk be transferred if need be to a safe environment,’’ she told The Post in a statement."
336,One dead after Canadian Air Force jet celebrating front-line workers crashes into home,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/canadian-air-force-jet-celebrating-front-line-workers-crashes/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"A Canadian Air Force jet crashed into a home while on a tribute tour for coronavirus front-line workers — leaving at least one person dead and another seriously injured, authorities and witnesses said.
The Royal Canadian Air Force said a Snowbirds plane — Canada’s equivalent of the US Navy’s Blue Angels — went down in Kamloops, northeast of Vancouver.
“It is with heavy hearts that we announce that one member of the CF Snowbirds team has died and one has sustained serious injuries,” the RCAF tweeted.
The deceased was identified as Captain Jenn Casey, a public affairs officer for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
Earlier, British Columbia Health Minister Adrian Dix said one person was in the hospital after paramedics and air ambulances responded to the crash.
Video posted on social media showed two Snowbirds taking off together and veering into the sky — when, seconds later, one of them rolled over and spiraled down to the ground.
The footage appears to show at least one person ejecting from the aircraft, before it disappears behind trees and an explosion can be heard.
Kerri Turatus, who lives in the neighborhood where the plane went down, told NBC News that the plane hit a house, engulfing it in flames. It wasn’t clear if anyone was home at the time.
It “sounded like a gunshot outside my window,” said Turatus, 30.
There was wreckage strewn in the street and a wing sticking out of her neighbor’s garage, she said.
Another neighbor, Kenny Hinds, said he saw a parachute about 20 feet above the house.
“I heard ‘bang, bang,’ and just as I looked before it left my view from the house beside me, I saw the Snowbird going straight down,” he said.
“I saw what looked like a parachute about, say, 20 feet over the house, and it disappeared from sight, and the parachute hadn’t fully deployed yet — it was still sort of straight up and down.”
The flight had been part of the cross-country “Operation Inspiration,” which launched April 29 in Nova Scotia to boost morale and celebrate first responders and healthcare workers amid the pandemic.

Brazil’s Health Ministry announced 14,919 new confirmed cases on Saturday, bringing its total to 233,142 – fourth-most after the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom.
Nationwide testing in Brazil lags far behind Europe, meaning the virus could be more widespread than what the numbers actually represent. Brazil had processed nearly 338,000 tests by the start of last week, with another 145,000 under analysis.
By comparison, Spain and Italy have each run roughly 1.9 million tests.
Cases are also surging in Mexico and Peru as Latin America grapples with the rapidly growing outbreak. Mexico registered 278 new deaths on Saturday – the most of any country in the world on that day.
With Brazil overtaking Spain and Italy – once considered the hotspots of the pandemic in Europe – President Jair Bolsonaro will face renewed criticism for his handling of the pandemic.
British medical journal The Lancet published an editorial earlier this month in which it labeled Bolsonaro as “the biggest threat” to Brazil’s efforts to fight the pandemic.
Brazil state governors have pushed for strict social isolation and quarantine measures, including closures of shops and restaurants. Bolsonaro has defied such efforts, arguing that the toll on the economy far outweighs quarantine efforts.
On April 20, he joined a protest calling to end social distancing and revive military dictatorship-era decrees.
After the resignation of a second health minister, Bolsonaro tweeted  “Unemployment, hunger and misery will be the future of those who support the tyranny of total isolation.” Nelson Teich resigned after only a month in charge, protesting against Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic.
Recently, a journalist asked him about the rapid spread of coronavirus in Brazil, to which the far-right president responded: “So what? What do you want me to do?”
Rio de Janeiro Gov. Wilson Witzel, a former ally of Bolsonaro, said “no one can do serious work with interference in ministries.” “That is why governors and mayors need to lead the pandemic crisis, and not you, Mr. President,” Witzel said on Twitter."

First of all, enough with the spitting.
I get why we’re all so fascinated by the notion that coronavirus baseball will be expectorate-free. Spitting is as synonymous with baseball as are home runs, stolen bases and poverty-crying owners. Guess what, though? Most players, understanding the logic behind the banishment, will go along with it. Those who mindlessly or defiantly hock a loogie will be asked to stop. The games won’t suffer. End of saga.
When you read the 67-page “2020 Operations Manual” that Major League Baseball sent to the Players Association on Friday night, however, you can find suggestions and recommendations — all of which must be approved by the union — that would potentially compromise the quality of the product, prove arduous to enforce or both if a season actually happens. Here are five that stand out:
Granted, baseball never would be confused with the National Hockey League of the 1970s. In the average campaign we get only a handful of fights. Yet we count on the teams to play with an intensity level that would lead to fights should something go awry. Would the elimination of that component, with “severe discipline” promised for those who violate the ban, turn down the heat among the competitors? Of course, it would be far worse if a fight did happen with disregard for the disciplinary consequences. We’d all be fretting the health implications of it.
How would Aaron Boone, Luis Rojas and their fellow managers feel about serving as the equivalent of teen-tour group leaders? “Members of the Traveling Party may not leave the Club’s hotel, and should not congregate in public areas of the hotel, for any reason unless approved in advance by appropriate Club personnel,” the proposal reads. Even if the managers get protected from legal liability, a reasonable assumption, imagine the public-relations hit of Player X contracting COVID-19 because Manager Y allowed him to leave the premises. Not that the scenario of Player X finding trouble by breaking the rules would be much better.
Baseball’s one-on-one nature, so different from the dynamic of football, basketball, hockey or soccer, leads to much downtime for position players who aren’t at bat or pitchers who aren’t on the mound. Those guys ideally capitalize on that downtime by talking through components of the game in the dugout — learning from one another and benefiting from each other’s company and knowledge. You can do that six feet apart, especially with no crowd noise. Can you do so as intimately and effectively? Probably not.
This one reads so awkwardly: “When the ball is out of play or in between pitches, fielders are encouraged to retreat several steps away from the baserunner.” Imagine an infielder consciously monitoring his movements that have come so naturally for so long. I wonder how much managers, coaches and umpires would push on this one. It sounds like more of an aspiration than a mandate.
For starters, that’ll be one smelly bus ride back to the hotel if no one showers at the ballpark. What intrigues me more is the closing off of the saunas, steam rooms, hydrotherapy pools and cryotherapy chambers as well as discouraging the usage of indoor batting cages. Players would be ramping up following a long shutdown, and many teams could be playing in the Florida and Arizona heat if their regular-season facilities aren’t open. If they can’t manage their bodies to the extent to which they have become accustomed, will we see an increase in injuries?"
339,"At least 100,000 cruise ship crew members still stuck at sea: report",https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/at-least-100000-cruise-ship-staffers-still-stuck-at-sea-report/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"At least 100,000 cruise ship staff remain stuck at sea more than two months after coronavirus crippled the industry — with many not even getting paid, according to a report Sunday.
Following a series of infections onboard ships, the cruise industry first shut down operations on March 13, with most passengers managing to get onto dry land by early April.
But two months after the closure, more than 100,000 crew are still stuck on ships still aimlessly cruising the seas waiting for permission to return to their homelands, according to an investigation by the Miami Herald.
Many are not getting paid because they are no longer officially working and US labor laws do not apply to the companies and ships registered abroad. Most also have no idea when they will finally be allowed by governments to dock and then eventually make it home, the paper says.
And there are still dangers, with 578 crew of various ships getting infected with COVID-19 at sea — at least seven fatally, the Herald said.
The conditions have left many so despondent that at least two crew members of different ships have jumped overboard in apparent suicides. Others have been on hunger strike.
“Here I am in a prison,” Gan Sungaralingum, 38, a crew member stuck on Carnival Corp.’s Sky Princess, told the paper.
Most of the cruise companies blamed government rules and regulations from preventing them from docking and fully disembarking during the pandemic.
“Our goal has been to repatriate our crew members as quickly as possible, but that has proven to be much more difficult in recent weeks because of port closures, country closures and global travel restrictions,” Carnival Corp. spokesman Roger Frizzell told the Herald.
“As a result, there have been numerous complications and challenges.
Disney Cruise Line insisted that the “health and well-being” of crew members was a priority. “We have a team working tirelessly to repatriate them,” spokesperson Kim Prunty told the Herald.
“With constantly changing requirements around the world and numerous borders still closed, this has proven to be an extremely complex process.”
MSC Cruises, meanwhile, says that 95 percent of the crew left at sea live in countries where borders are still closed.
“We are constantly in contact with the Governments in these countries at the highest level on behalf of our crew and in some discreet cases we were able to persuade them to allow our crew back,” spokesperson Luca Biondolilo told the paper.
Either way, the delay could forever damage the industry, experts warn.
The cruise companies “have to show they are going to have the capability in an emergency situation to get people at scale off of the ship and back home,” Rockford Weitz, director of the Maritime Studies Program at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, told the paper.
“They have to be able to convince their customers they can find solutions and work constructively with public health authorities. The time for excuses at this point in May … there’s no excuse for not finding the way home,” he said."
340,AMI awaiting PPP loan worth $5-6M amid coronavirus pandemic,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/ami-awaiting-ppp-loan-worth-5-6m-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Financially struggling American Media still has its hand out, waiting for a loan valued at between $5 million and $6 million under the federal Payroll Protection Program run by the Small Business Administration, The Post has learned.
An AMI spokesman declined to comment this week on whether the owner of the National Enquirer, Us Weekly and other celebrity titles actually received the money yet.
“American Media made the decision to apply for PPP support in an effort to secure hundreds of jobs that might have been lost as we and other publishers continue to navigate the current economic climate created by the COVID-19 pandemic,” a spokesman told the Daily Beast, which weeks ago broke the story about the loan application.
The potential loan from the feds raised eyebrows in many circles, with insiders noting the company’s cash-flow problems were hampering operations before the coronavirus hit and shuttered newsstands across the country.
On the political front, AMI got mixed in the 2016 hush-money payments scandal surrounding two women who had accused President Trump of having sex with them years before he ran for president.
AMI boss David Pecker and its majority owner Chatham Asset Management, headed by Anthony Melchiorre, have been trying to complete the sale of the troubled supermarket tabloid to Jimmy Cohen, the chief executive of mag wholesale distributor Hudson News. The deal was announced over a year ago.
The company returns to the spotlight on Sunday at 10 p.m. with CNN’s broadcast of the heavily promoted documentary: “Scandalous. The Untold Story of the National Enquirer.” The documentary includes commentary by Ken Auletta, Carl Bernstein, Ronan Farrow and Post Media Ink columnist Keith J. Kelly."
341,Two more New York regions close to meeting criteria to reopen: Gov. Cuomo,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/two-more-new-york-regions-close-to-reopening-gov-cuomo/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"Another two of the Empire State’s economic regions are on the verge of reopening, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday, as an additional 139 New Yorkers succumbed to the coronavirus.
Western New York and the Capital Region have fulfilled six of the seven criteria — measuring hospitalizations, death rates, available beds, testing and tracing — to phase certain businesses back online.
The only box left to tick is an expansion of their contact tracing capacity, Cuomo said, offering the state’s help to get the regions up to snuff.
“They are now qualified for reopening,” said Cuomo during an Albany press briefing. “We’ll be working with both the Capital Region and Western New York to get that tracing up. But that is a purely administrative function.
“Working together with the regions, we can get that done.”
Planned tailoring of the total hospitalization and fatality metrics in regions where those numbers were so consistently low that measured decline was difficult to gauge helped get those two sectors to the finish line, according to the governor’s office.
Five other regions — Central New York, the Finger Lakes, the Mohawk Valley, the North Country and the Southern Tier — have already begun the first phase of reopening, which includes such low-risk businesses as construction, manufacturing, landscaping and curbside pick-up retail.
Long Island, the Mid-Hudson and New York City are still on the outside looking in, with the Big Apple the furthest off, having met just three of the seven criteria through Sunday.
Cuomo teased the good news for Western New York and the Capital Region as deaths continued to mount statewide.
Another 139 New Yorkers were lost to the bug in the 24-hour period ending at midnight Sunday, raising the overall toll to 22,619 confirmed fatalities.
“At a different time and place if I had that news to deliver, that would be incredibly shocking to people,” said Cuomo. “Only in this environment is it not shocking and, relative to where we were, it’s good news.”"
342,Wuhan writer says China claimed coronavirus was ‘controllable’,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/wuhan-writer-says-china-claimed-coronavirus-was-controllable/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"A blogger in Wuhan, China, said state media outlets in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic were peddling information that COVID-19 couldn’t be passed between people.
“My daughter returned from a holiday in Japan on January 22, two days after it had been revealed that the novel coronavirus in Wuhan was being spread from human to human,” Fang Fang writes in an excerpt of her upcoming book “Wuhan Diary” published by the UK’s Sunday Times.
“Official media sources had consistently been telling us it was ‘not contagious between people; it’s controllable and preventable.'”
Fang — an award-winning poet and fiction writer who blogged about her experiences in Wuhan during the virus — said she went to pick up her daughter at the airport and she found the streets nearly free of cars or pedestrians.
“Those few days were when panic and fright were at their height in the city. We both wore face masks. The anxiety and stress that were permeating the entire city were also there in the car with us,” she wrote.
“I dropped my daughter off at her place and didn’t get home until 1 am. I turned on the computer and immediately saw the news: quarantine would be going into effect imminently.”
Fang, 65, originally published her writings on social media sites WeChat and Weibo, but they were quickly deleted by censors.
Still her diary went viral, and will be published as an English-language book in June.
She said that by Jan. 25, state-run media reported that top-level Chinese leaders were closely monitoring the outbreak and a team of medical experts had arrived to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, from Shanghai.
“But that was also when the period of true suffering arrived here in Wuhan the number of people infected with the coronavirus exploded. The hospital system was brought to the brink of collapse. The infected ended up traipsing all over the city, in the wind and rain, searching in vain for treatment. We all felt completely helpless in the face of these patients crying out, desperate for help,” she wrote.
Writing on Feb. 1, she said her older brother who teaches at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, first told her about how contagious the coronavirus could be.
“On December 31, he forwarded to me an essay entitled ‘Suspected Case of Virus of Unknown Origin in Wuhan.’ However, it wasn’t long before the official government line came down: ‘Not contagious between people; it’s controllable and preventable.’ As soon as we heard that, everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief,” she wrote."
343,"NYC restaurant’s reopening will include changes like masks, food lockers",https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/nyc-restaurants-will-have-to-pivot-some-sharply-in-reopening/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The lengthy coronavirus lockdowns will force New York City’s restaurateurs to pivot when they finally start to welcome customers — and some pivots will be sharper than others.
Stratis Morfogen, founder of Philippe Chow and co-founder of the Brooklyn Chop House, was gearing up to open his new concept, Brooklyn Dumpling Shop, in the East Village just before COVID-19 hit.
The 500-square-foot space at St. Marks Place and First Avenue, a 24/7 operation featuring 32 kinds of dumplings including peanut butter and jam, matzo ball soup, and wonton with vanilla ice cream, was originally planning to offer a Shake Shack-style pickup counter and limited seating.
Two weeks into lockdown, however, Morfogen changed almost everything. The shop — now slated to open in July — vows zero human interaction. Instead of a server behind a counter, patrons will be greeted by an 11-foot-high wall of lockers, which will contain orders of steaming hot dumplings.
“When restaurants reopen, nobody is going to be saying, ‘Do you feel like Chinese or Italian tonight?’ ” Morfogen told Side Dish. “It will be, ‘Where do you feel safest?’ ”
Restaurants planning summer openings and reopenings are introducing disposable masks and menus, taking customers’ temperatures and pressing the city for more leeway to serve diners outdoors.
But in the case of Brooklyn Dumpling Shop, hungry guests will get a high-tech experience that’s pointedly lacking when it comes to the human touch.
The front of the shop will be staffed by a single greeter wearing a face covering and gloves, of course, who will beckon customers through a device that’s able to scan body temperatures.
If a patron draws a red light instead of a green one, it could mean they have a fever — or perhaps that they were holding a cup of hot coffee. For a final verdict, the greeter leads the customer to a wall unit that takes wrist temperatures. If the second reading lands in the red zone, sorry, no dumplings, according to Morfogen.
Only two customers will be allowed into the shop at a time (versus a planned capacity of 10 for the earlier design). Once inside, customers who haven’t already ordered from their phones can visit one of two wiped-down self-ordering kiosks.
The kiosks are equipped with heat-sensing screens that can detect fingers and credit cards hovering above them and which don’t need to be touched. Once finished waving their fingers and credit card over them, customers finally come face-to-face with the wall of lockers.
“The locker goes from red, when your order is in, to yellow, which means two minutes out, to green, when you scan your phone on a keypad, the locker opens, and you take your food and go,” Morfogen says.
Cooks place the order in the individual lockers, further limiting contact between kitchen and customer. The lockers also are heated and hygienically disinfected, Morfogen notes.
What’s more, “it’s very cost-effective. You save three people every 24 hours of labor.”
Brooklyn Dumpling Shop may be better suited to this setup than most restaurants. Even before the virus, the plan was to showcase a hulking, stainless-steel machine in the front window that’s capable of cranking out 30,000 dumplings an hour.
“We call it the dumpling lab,” Morfogen says, with a plan for the machine to supply future locations in addition to the East Village flagship. “I hope we need it!”
The automated locker system, developed by Chicago-based Apex Supply Chain Technologies, is a long way from vending machines, and costs around $100,000 depending on software options.
Chief Executive Mike Wills says “scan-and-go” technology, which was first used in airports and water parks, will gain traction with restaurants post-COVID.
Nevertheless, such newfangled tech remains mostly unfamiliar to most industry players, as does the idea of a zero human interaction eatery.
“It may be happening but it’s not a widespread trend I’ve heard of,” says Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance."
344,Trump rips ‘grossly incompetent’ Obama following coronavirus criticism,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/trump-rips-grossly-incompetent-obama-following-coronavirus-criticism/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"President Trump blasted former President Barack Obama as “grossly incompetent,” a day after his predecessor criticized the administration’s handling of the coronavirus.
“Look, he was an incompetent president, that’s all I can say. Grossly incompetent,” Trump told reporters at the White House after returning from spending the weekend at Camp David.
The president was responding to remarks Obama made in online commencement speeches on Saturday, but noted that he had not heard the comments.
“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing. A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge,” Obama said while addressing graduates of historically black colleges and universities.
Trump left the White House for Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains, on Friday.
He was accompanied by White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and a number of Republican members of Congress.
Asked what they discussed, Trump said it was a “working weekend.”
“So I think we had a great weekend. We did a lot of terrific meetings. Tremendous progress is being made on many fronts, including coming up with a cure for this horrible plague that has beset our country,” Trump said Sunday. “It was a working weekend, it was a good weekend. A lot of very good things have happened.”"

Chuck Schumer wants the feds to take the gloves off and knock out scammers peddling phony coronavirus cures.
With bogus remedies like music therapy, high-dose vitamin C injections, and Chinese herb concoctions infecting the market, Schumer said it’s time for the Federal Trade Commission to take a hard line and slam the scammers with heavy fines.
“Right now what is the FTC doing to these quacks, to these fake scammers who are trying to take advantage of people in a desperate situation? Nothing,” Schumer said Sunday. “A slap on the wrist. They send them a so-called warning letter that has no consequence. You can take this warning letter and rip it up and put it in the garbage.”
“And the word is out,” he said. “You come up with these fake scams you’re just going to get a letter. What does that say to scammers? Join the fun. Make money off innocent people.”
Schumer said the dozens of warning letters sent out by the federal agency have failed to curtail the flow of phony cures to a gullible and vulnerable market.
One Florida company has been selling intravenous infusions of vitamin C with a promise that it boosts the immune system and protects against the deadly global pandemic.
A New York-based company is peddling “Royal Jelly,” claiming the bee-pollen-based remedy can “boost your energy and cognitive functions.”
Yet another company is selling tunes with the promise that music frequencies can help resist the coronavirus, Schumer said. He said others pitch everything from homeopathic treatments and electromagnetic shields that claim to guard against the virus.
“Make no mistake: The FTCs warnings have sounded the alarm here and served as a necessary action,” he said. “But the old adage of ‘fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me’ applies more than ever in this case. Warnings might not be enough.”
“It’s time to hit the scammers in the same place they are hitting the American consumer — deep in the pocket.”"

Manley, 61, is on oxygen in a Washington, D.C.-area hospital to help with breathing problems he began experiencing two weeks ago. The man once dubbed “The Secretary of Defense” tested positive for the virus on May 2
“I just think he is scared.” Manley’s daughter Dalis told the Washington Post, adding that doctors said Dexter has pneumonia.
Dalis Manley told the paper her dad, who had been regularly wearing a mask, believes he may have contracted the virus when he visited a convenience store without a mask on.
After initially experiencing shortness of breath and a fever which ranged from 101 to 104 degrees, he recently began coughing.
Manley’s son Dexter II told the paper his dad “hasn’t gotten worse, but they’re worried about his breathing,” while someone else close to the family who spoke to Manley’s doctors said Manley is “stable and resting comfortably,” adding doctors said Manley “is a big strong guy and is not in imminent danger.”
Fourteen years ago, Manley — who battled drug issues during his NFL career, failing multiple league drug tests — underwent 10 1/2 hours of brain surgery to treat a Colloid cyst that was putting pressure on his brain.
A member of the Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XXII champion Redskins, Manley had 97.5 career sacks and was an All-Pro in 1986."

“Well, I’m glad Mr. Obama has a new job as Joe Biden’s press secretary,” Peter Navarro said Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.”
“I note for the record that, in his speech that I read, there was no mention of manufacturing, no mention of China. As far as I’m concerned, his administration was a kumbaya of incompetence, in which we saw millions of manufacturing jobs go off to China,” Navarro added.
Obama struck out at President Trump in two online commencement addresses on Saturday.
“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” the former president said. “A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”
Navarro also set his sights on Joe Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, criticizing him for being weak on China.
Asked about an op-ed Biden wrote in the USA Today in January that warned Trump about trusting Chinese President Xi Jinping during the coronavirus pandemic, he replied: “Well, Joe Biden’s got 40 years of sucking up to the Chinese, including the eight years as vice president.”
Navarro said Americans will decide who’s stronger on the economy when they decide who they want in the White House this November.
“So we’ll have Joe Biden, long friend of China, President Donald J. Trump, the only president in modern history to stand up to China going into November. And what this is going to be about, it’s not going to be about the pandemic, it’s going to be about jobs,” he said."

CityMD will provide free coronavirus tests to uninsured New Yorkers as part of a partnership with the city aimed at getting tens of thousands of people tested every day, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday.
The urgent care company is offering testing at each of its 123 walk-in sites in the area, Hizzoner said, enabling 6,000 “PCR” swabs a day at its locations alone.
CityMD is covering the costs for those without insurance, an offer the mayor praised as “an extraordinary commitment to the people of this city.”
The move puts the city “ahead of our goal” to be able to offer 20,000 tests every day by May 25, de Blasio said.
“We have now hit the goal, a week early. We’re at that capacity now and we’re going to keep growing,” he promised.
“With 20,000 a day you’re almost at 150,000 tests a week. Our goal is to continue to build that rapidly,” he said.
CityMD is currently prioritizing the PCR tests — which detect if someone is currently infected with the virus — to healthcare workers, first responders, those showing symptoms and anyone in contact with someone who has COVID-19, its website shows.
In the coming weeks, at least 280,000 residents will also be able to get free antibody testing from appointments at five locations in the city, said de Blasio, who cautioned that the testing “isn’t perfect, but it is helpful.”
An “army of tracers” will also soon be available to evaluate those who might be at risk from contacts who are positive, the mayor said. Already 500 people have completed specialist training with Johns Hopkins University, with another 1,000 going through the course now.
They will start work on May 24, with at least 1,000 tracers expected in the city by June, he said — with the ultimate goal of up to 10,000 in the city.
“In the next, literally, two weeks, you’re going to see a vast testing and tracing operation come alive like we’ve never seen before in the city. And he this is just the beginning,” he said.
“This vast army is coming together very, very quickly.”"

Andrew Cuomo was tested for the coronavirus live during his Sunday press briefing to promote more widespread screening, including for the first New Yorkers cleared to return to work.
“It is so fast and easy that even a governor can take this test,” Cuomo told reporters in Albany, before rising from his seat to greet a PPE-clad doctor.
The governor hammed it up as the doctor produced a swab and instructed him to close his eyes.
“Question the doctor, that’s OK,” Cuomo said. “Why do I need to close my eyes?”
The doctor explained that the test can cause some people to tear up, as she inserted the swab into the governor’s nostril for a few seconds.
“That’s it? Nothing else?” asked Cuomo. “That is the whole test. I’m not in pain, not in discomfort.”
Cuomo — who said that he has been tested before — underwent the exam to coax other New Yorkers into following suit.
“Now we have more testing capacity and more sites than we’re actually using,” said Cuomo. “We have drive-in sites that can do 15,000 [tests] per day, we’re doing about 5,000 per day.”
And that list grew even larger Sunday, as Cuomo announced a state partnership with CVS pharmacies to begin testing in some 60 locations statewide, each with a capacity for at least 50 tests per day.
The governor additionally expanded the state’s guidelines on who should get tested to include New Yorkers who have been or would be cleared to return to work under the first phase of the state’s reopening plan.
Industries covered in that phase include construction, landscaping, manufacturing and retail locations which offer curbside pick-up.
So far, five of the state’s 10 economic regions have been cleared to reopen by meeting seven criteria on hospital admissions, available beds, testing and tracing.
Cuomo closed the presser by saying that he would await the results of his latest test for the contagion.
“If I’m not here tomorrow, it means I tested positive,” he said. “Otherwise, we’ll see you here tomorrow.”"
350,WH adviser: CDC ‘let the country down’ with lack of early coronavirus testing,https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/wh-adviser-slams-cdc-over-lack-of-early-coronavirus-testing/,2020-05-17 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The White House official in charge of coordinating the administration’s efforts to corral medical equipment in the fight against the coronavirus on Sunday blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for dropping the ball on early testing.
“Early on in this virus, the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing because not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test. And that did set us back,” Peter Navarro, the coordinator for the Defense Production Act, said Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.”
The CDC in early February sent testing kits to the states that were contaminated during production at the agency’s lab in Atlanta — a problem that led to faulty results and delayed the process for weeks.
CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield testified in March that the initial test kit “did not perform the way we wanted it to perform.”
The agency eventually released new testing kits.
Navarro, who is also the White House trade adviser, responded to a group of Democratic senators who urged President Trump to use the Defense Production Act to increase the supply of protective equipment and testing kits, saying they’re “dead wrong.”
“These senators are looking in the rear-view mirror. We had the same discussion six weeks ago about ventilators. They were saying the exact same thing, and what we did with ventilators was basically get a situation now where by June we’re going to have over a hundred thousand of them,” he said, explaining the partnership between General Motors and the government in creating ventilators.
“We’re going to have more ventilators than America ever needs and we’re going to be able to export those ventilators,” he said. “These Democratic senators ought to get out more often and see what the Trump administration is doing.”
He also reiterated President Trump’s assertions that having businesses shuttered and enforcing stay-at-home measures for too long could create dangerous conditions.
“So if you contrast this complete lockdown where some of the people in the medical community want to just run and hide until the virus is extinguished, that’s going to not only take a huge toll on the American economy, it’s going to kill many more people than virus, the China virus ever would,” he said."

Italy will reopen its movie theaters next month as it begins to “accept” the risks that come with easing lockdown restrictions, the government announced.
The country will allow cinemas to return to business June 15 with social distancing measures such as staggered seating and online reservations, Deadline reported.
“We are facing a calculated risk with the awareness that the contagion curve could rise again,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Saturday.
He said Italy could “not afford” to wait until a vaccine was developed to restart the economy.
“We are taking this risk and we have to accept it, otherwise we could not restart,” Conte said.
The country became one of the first outside of China to implement strict lockdown measures in early March when it emerged as the initial epicenter in Europe of the coronavirus pandemic.
Italy has seen more than 224,000 cases of the infectious bug, resulting in at least 31,000 deaths, according to the latest figures from John Hopkins University."

A study found the coronavirus was taken to an animal market in Wuhan, China, by a person already infected with the disease, according to a report.
“The publicly available genetic data does not point to cross-species transmission of the virus at the market,” said Alina Chan, a molecular biologist, and Shing Zhan, an evolutionary biologist, the Mail on Sunday reported.
In their paper, the two said they were “surprised” to discover the coronavirus was “already pre-adapted to human transmission.”
But they said all routes for animal to human transmission – including from bats – must be examined.
“The possibility that a non-genetically engineered precursor could have adapted to humans while being studied in a laboratory should be considered,” the paper said.
It was written by Chan and Ben Deverman, scientists at the Broad Institute, a research facility affiliated with Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Zhan, from the University of British Columbia.
The development adds to the growing criticism that the Chinese ruling Communist Party downplayed the severity of the outbreak and failed to report accurate numbers of the virus in the country.
“We need to get to the bottom of many things in relation to COVID-19,” said Bob Seely, a member of the British Parliament. “We need to know where this virus began, why we were told at one time there was no human transmission, and what was the role of the Chinese Communist Party.”
President Trump, who has blasted Beijing for a lack of transparency in its response to the pandemic, has claimed the coronavirus began in a Wuhan lab.
The US intelligence community, which has concluded that the virus was not “man made or genetically modified,” is investigating where the outbreak first occurred."

On Friday night, Major League Baseball sent its 67-page “2020 Operations Manual” to the Players Association, and let’s lead with the observation that this reads like a serious, thoughtful proposal for how to conduct a team sport during a pandemic. If necessity is the mother of invention, then desperation could be the father. We know how desperate the big league owners are to cobble together a season, and their steward Rob Manfred honored that urgency with this initial proposal.
In addition to oodles of safety/health protocols that cover both testing and travel, the document features a dizzying array of adjustments to life at the ballpark and on the field, from social distancing in the dugout (and using those unoccupied crowd seats to house some of the uniformed personnel who aren’t in the game) to a ban on spitting to infielders being instructed to this doozy: “When the ball is out of play or in between pitches, fielders are encouraged to retreat several steps away from the baserunner.” Think of how counterintuitive that will be for infielders who have spent a decade or two playing the game a certain way.
Of course, we’ve all spent these past couple of months going against so much that we’ve learned, and without a coronavirus vaccine available, it’s either this sanitized version of the national pastime or no version at all. If the players and owners find common ground on the economics and the players find peace with putting themselves in harm’s way, neither a guarantee — nor government officials blessing this endeavor — we’ll take what we can get.
Much like we would treat an 82-game season as legitimate because of the circumstances that compelled it, it would be silly to scoff at baseball compromised by regulations to keep anyone from getting sick or dying. Really, the only scoffing to be done would be to question whether baseball should be putting itself out there at all given the legitimate potential of something going horribly awry.
We can hold that debate another day, though. If they’re going to give this a shot, they can’t do so cavalierly, and the weirdness — not even out-of-town scores on the scoreboard, to limit people at the stadium! — equates diligence.
The tweaks might change baseball history since the game is, as we know, is a game of inches. Better to have some baseball history, though, however weird, than none at all."
354,LIRR trains to add capacity as Long Island eyes coronavirus reopening,https://nypost.com/2020/05/24/lirr-trains-to-add-capacity-as-li-eyes-coronavirus-reopening/,2020-05-24 00:00:00,"Long Island Rail Road trains will run with extra cars to accommodate social distancing in time for the island’s anticipated reopening from the coronavirus this week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.
“Long Island is on track to meet the numbers on Wednesday,” said Cuomo, referring to the seven state metrics for reopening measuring hospital admissions, deaths, available beds, testing and tracing. “We’re preparing for Long Island to open.”
Cuomo also announced a handful of other reopenings: Campgrounds and RV parks can reopen Monday, while veterinary practices can resume service on Tuesday.
Part of the effort to re-open Long Island is shoring up the LIRR to ensure that they can safely serve those cleared to head back to work under the first phase, which includes such sectors as construction, manufacturing, landscaping and curbside pick-up retail, Cuomo told reporters at the Jones Beach Theatre in Wantagh, LI.
“They’re going to add more cars to the trains, so people can space out and socially distance when Long Island opens,” said Cuomo. “I want people to remember that a mask is mandatory on public transportation.
“I think you’re making a mistake, a grave mistake if you don’t use a mask in your own personal life.”
The extra trains are a precaution in addition to the efforts to disinfect every MTA train and bus every day.
While Long Island is expected to reopen Wednesday, the Mid-Hudson is on track to ease back into normalcy even earlier, Cuomo said, with the metrics pointing to a Tuesday reopening.
That leaves just one of the state’s 10 economic regions on the outside looking in: New York City.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has said that the Big Apple is on pace to catch up as early as June 1, and Cuomo has said nothing to dampen that expectation, so long as the Big Apple meets the metrics.
Still, the governor urged caution.
“Everybody’s paid a high price for what we’ve gone through,” he said. “Some people have paid an extraordinarily high price.”
None has paid a higher price than the 23,391 New Yorkers now confirmed to have died to the coronavirus, including 109 in the 24-hour period ending at midnight Sunday.
After the state logged 84 deaths in the period prior — the lowest single-day total since late March — the toll jumped back up on Saturday, a stark reminder that the battle is not yet won."
355,Videos show crowds drinking inside Long Island bar despite coronavirus shutdown,https://nypost.com/2020/05/24/videos-show-crowds-at-long-island-bar-despite-coronavirus-shutdown/,2020-05-24 00:00:00,"A Long Island bar got into hot water over the weekend after apparently allowing dozens of customers inside the establishment to drink beverages in violation of the state’s coronavirus shutdown.
Videos posted on social media showed scores of maskless people packed inside the Dublin Deck Tiki Bar and Grill in Patchogue on Friday night as music played.
“Everybody’s so thirsty, let’s go!” someone can be heard shouting in one of the clips, as a crowd of people knocks back beers at the bar.
“Finally back to normal!” a reveler yells.
Suffolk County police received multiple 911 calls on Friday night about the bar not complying with Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s “PAUSE” order, but said no summonses were issued, Newsday reported.
Reps for the bar apologized in a Facebook post on Saturday, saying they’ll stick to social-distancing rules moving forward. The Facebook page has since been deleted.
“We apologize to anyone who may have been offended by the videos that surfaced,” read the post, according to Newsday. “We assure you it was not intended and will not happen again.”
Co-owner Frank Mills claimed the bar allowed patrons inside during a “quick rainfall.” Most of them were boaters parked at the nearby marina who were ordering meals to go, he said.
“Everybody decided to run inside out of the rain and they overwhelmed us,” Mills told the outlet. “It was that simple. It has never happened before and it will never happen again.”
The crowds may have acted inappropriately because they were itching to socialize, Mills added.
“Everybody hunkered down. We did what we were supposed to do,” Mills said. “You can call it what you want but they’re chomping at the bit to go do something.”
At a press conference on Sunday, the governor’s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, blasted the customers’ actions as “stupid.”
“From what I understand, the photos show people were in this space and they weren’t wearing masks. That’s stupid. Stupid for you, it’s stupid for your surrounding patrons, it’s stupid for the bar,” DeRosa said.
DeRosa noted that the watering hole said it was just providing shelter from the rain, and that enforcement was up to Suffolk County cops.
“I take them at their word that that’s what happened, but moving forward they should be on notice, and again the enforcement is up to the locals,” she said.
Cuomo added: “It’s supposed to be curbside pickup, right? That doesn’t sound like curbside pickup.”
Suffolk Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart said that by the time cops responded to the bar, about 85 percent of the customers had cleared out.
Cops said they followed up with the establishment and other Suffolk County businesses throughout the weekend.
Dublin Deck didn’t immediately return a call from The Post on Sunday night."

“A high school swim party that I’m sure everybody thought was harmless,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson told reporters of the gathering.
“They’re young, they’re swimming, they’re just having activity and positive cases resulted from that,” Hutchinson said, without elaborating on the number who were infected.
The carelessness and resulting infections are “just an encouragement for us to be disciplined in our activities,” the governor added.
“During this Memorial (Day) weekend, we want to be out and we want to enjoy ourselves, we want to remember this holiday and those that have served our country and given their lives in service of our country.
“But let’s be safe and let’s be disciplined at the same time,” he told reporters.
The new cases are part of a “second peak” of infections in the state, he said. Arkansas has dealt with the outbreak by closing schools, but has not required residents to stay at home.
Earlier this month, two people infected at least 38 members of a rural church in the state — including three who died."

Churches in the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located, have been able to hold services since May 1 following the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions, provided they adhere to official social distancing and hygiene rules.
“This situation shows how important it is that all of us stay alert and avoid becoming careless, especially now during the easing of restrictions. The virus is still there and will spread,” Hesse state health minister Kai Klose said.
He said the authorities hoped that identifying those who attended the service at a Baptist church on May 10 would help prevent others being infected.
It was not immediately clear whether all the 107 with the coronavirus attended the service, or whether the tally includes people who were infected by those who did.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has risen to 178,281, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 31 to 8,247."

Singaporean infectious disease experts said they found that the virus “could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness,” according to a joint paper from the country’s National Center for Infectious Diseases and the Academy of Medicine.
Researchers looked at the “viral load” in 73 COVID-19 patients to measure whether the bug was still viable and could infect anyone.
“Based on the accumulated data since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the infectious period of [coronavirus] in symptomatic individuals may begin around 2 days before the onset of symptoms, and persists for about 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms,” the researchers wrote.
Patients may still test positive after two weeks, but tests could be picking up fragments of the virus that are no longer viable for spreading the infection, researchers said.
“Active viral replication drops quickly after the first week, and viable virus was not found after the second week of illness,” researchers wrote.
The researchers suggested that the findings could inform hospitals’ decisions about when to discharge patients.
In the US, many hospitals require patients test negative for the virus twice to be considered recovered from COVID-19.
Though the sample size was small, researchers are confident that their findings will be replicated in larger studies, NCID executive director Leo Yee-Sin told Singaporean newspaper the Strait Times.
“Scientifically, I’m very confident that there is enough evidence that the person is no longer infectious after 11 days,” she said."
359,Wuhan lab admits to having three live strains of bat coronavirus on site,https://nypost.com/2020/05/24/wuhan-lab-admits-to-having-three-live-strains-of-bat-coronavirus/,2020-05-24 00:00:00,"The Chinese lab eyed as a potential source of COVID-19 has admitted having three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site — but insisted none are the source of the global pandemic.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology has since 2004 “isolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats,” its director Wang Yanyi said in an interview that aired Saturday, according to Agence France-Presse.
“Now we have three strains of live viruses… But their highest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8 percent,” Yanyi said, referring to the coronavirus strain that causes COVID-19.
“It’s an obvious difference,” she said, according to AFP.
Yanyi rejected the idea that the pandemic started in her lab — one pushed by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — as “pure fabrication.”
Her scientists had never “encountered, researched or kept the virus” until it received samples on December 30, when it had already unknowingly taken hold on Wuhan, the contagion’s epicenter, she said.
“In fact, like everyone else, we didn’t even know the virus existed,” she said of the new virus that as of Sunday had infected more than 5.3 million and killed more than 340,000 worldwide.
“How could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it?”
Chinese scientists have always said that the virus first emerged at a wet market selling live animals in Wuhan.
But US authorities raised suspicions over the lab at the heart of the epicenter — claims that the World Health Organization has insisted are purely “speculative” without evidence being offered.
Chinese Foreign minister Wang Yi on Sunday claimed US politicians chose to “fabricate rumors” about the origins to “stigmatize China.”
He said China would be “open” to international cooperation to identify the source of the novel coronavirus, as long as any investigation is “free of political interference.”

Protesters flooding streets across America are putting themselves at risk of catching the coronavirus — and likely exacerbating its ongoing spread, officials have warned.
“If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned those taking to the streets in her city.
Bottoms was one of many to note the dangers of thousands suddenly ignoring any form of lockdown or social distancing to protest George Floyd’s caught-on-camera death in police custody.
She stressed that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.”
Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks.
Even those with masks are not guaranteed protection, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) saying cloth masks are more for stopping infected people spreading the virus than protecting the wearer.
“Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” warned Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis.
The protests are almost certainly going to fuel infections and damage efforts to contain the pandemic through lockdowns and tightly organized social distancing, Minnesota’s health commissioner warned.
“We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” said Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis where Floyd died during the Memorial Day arrest.
The ongoing protests come as the US has seen more than 1.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases with 103,781 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

361,Hospital failed to protect nurse from NY’s coronavirus ‘patient zero’: suit,https://nypost.com/2020/05/31/nurse-for-nys-patient-zero-contracts-virus-sues-hospital/,2020-05-31 00:00:00,"A nurse who treated the state’s coronavirus “patient zero” says in a new lawsuit that she and her family ended up battling the contagion — and debilitating fallout — because of gross negligence at her hospital.
The healthcare worker and others at NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville “were offered up as sacrificial lambs to be slaughtered by the COVID-19 virus,’’ her lawyers told The Post.
The nurse, who is anonymous in the Manhattan Supreme Court suit filed Saturday, helped care for onetime ailing lawyer Lawrence Garbuz at the Westchester County hospital after he was admitted Feb. 27, the court papers say.
Garbuz, 50 — who Gov. Cuomo dubbed the state’s coronavirus “patient zero’’ — was admitted “with an initial intake diagnosis of pneumonia and exhibiting apparent signs of COVID-19 infection’’ — yet it would take him up to five days to be tested, the suit says.
A different nurse who tended to Garbuz in the intensive-care unit told a doctor Feb. 29, “I think this patient is COVID’’ — but her concerns were ignored as “alarmist” and “paranoid,” the court papers allege.
A day later, the plaintiff nurse also “voiced grave concerns” to her supervisor that Garbuz was “exhibiting obvious signs of COVID-19,” the papers say. Yet she and other staff were provided surgical masks instead of the N-95 masks and face shields that the hospital was already requiring for its workers who were coming into contact with coronavirus patients, the document says.
Garbuz of New Rochelle tested positive for the deadly contagion by March 2, the suit says.
But the plaintiff nurse — who lives in Hartsdale and still works at the facility — already had contracted the virus and gave it to her husband and son, the court papers say. The nurse and her husband are in their early 50s, while the boy is a teen, her lawyers said.
The nurse and her family “sustained serious, irreversible injuries as a result of her exposure to COVID-19,” including “decrease or loss of lung function,” mental anguish and other physical and mental injuries, the court documents claim.
The hospital failed to follow CDC and Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines “for the treatment of suspected COVID-19 positive patients,” the papers allege.
New York Presbyterian “completely disregarded the signs that Westchester Patient Zero was COVID-19 positive, as well as those warnings provided by hospital staff, including the concerns voiced by a critical care nurse on February 29, 2020 and by plaintiff NURSE ANONYMOUS on March 1, 2020,” the filings charge.
The “intentional and/or wonton disregard for the safety of NURSE ANONYMOUS, and others, was so extreme and outrageous in character as to go beyond all bounds of decency,” the suit adds.
The nurse’s lawyers, Michael Barrows and Jason Goldfarb, told The Post, “Knowingly allowing these dedicated health workers to treat a suspected COVID-19 positive patient without proper PPE equipment shocks the conscience.”
Garbuz was the first known coronavirus case in New Rochelle, the state’s initial epicenter of the pandemic. He was released from the hospital in late March and has said he had no idea he had the contagion when he started suffering symptoms in late February.
NewYork-Presbyterian declined comment to The Post.

362,Florida shows the right way to lock down for coronavirus — and loosen up,https://nypost.com/2020/05/31/florida-shows-the-right-way-to-lock-down-and-loosen-up/,2020-05-31 00:00:00,"For a moment in April, the Internet tried to cancel Florida. Photos showing crowds flocking to Jacksonville Beach amid the pandemic sent the hashtag #FloridaMorons trending on Twitter. The media spun scenes of ignorant spring breakers endangering themselves and others. Here was Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, joining neighboring state Georgia’s “experiment in human sacrifice,” as a writer for The Atlantic put it, by letting locals lift restrictions on their own.
Nearly a month later, Jacksonville’s Duval County reports new COVID-19 hospitalizations in the single digits. Rates of hospitalizations, cases and deaths remain steady across Florida. So far, fewer Floridians have died of the novel coronavirus than in New York’s nursing homes alone (2,259 compared with 5,800, at least). As Politico recently concluded, “Florida just doesn’t look nearly as bad as the national news media . . . have been predicting for about two months now.”
Florida’s approach — a decentralized health response with targeted lockdowns and quarantines reinforced by voluntary social distancing — appears to have worked.
Other populous states adopting this approach, such as Tennessee under Gov. Bill Lee, have seen similar success. The lesson: It is possible to keep a lid on the virus even while gradually reopening.
Florida is large and diverse. If Jacksonville and Tallahassee are the Deep South, the state’s I-4 corridor, running from Tampa through Orlando to Daytona Beach, is pure Middle America. South Florida is the polyglot “New Havana,” a bubbling melting pot between the Gulf and Gold Coasts. Unsurprisingly, DeSantis gave counties leeway in responding to COVID-19.
Miami-Dade County shuttered all its nonessential businesses before New York City did, and it was local leaders who first closed many Florida beaches and cracked down against large gatherings.
When Florida did issue a stay-at-home order (two days after New York), it targeted the state’s 4 million seniors and residents with underlying medical conditions.
Statewide rules issued on April 1 broadly limited “nonessential” activities and business, but by this point, Floridians had already imposed their own restrictions.
Meantime, the state government in Tallahassee was ramping up testing and issuing personal protective equipment, ultimately totaling more than 7 million masks and 1 million gloves. By late April, the state was conducting some 12,000 daily COVID-19 tests, with capacity for more, and drive-through facilities alone had conducted more than 100,000 tests by early May. (New York, by contrast, was doing 20,000 tests daily in mid-April, at least 100,000 below what it needed, considering the size of its outbreak.)
Florida’s response to COVID-19 focused on nursing homes. More than a third of the nation’s COVID-19 deaths have occurred among the residents and staff of long-term-care facilities — a share that jumps as high as 80 percent in Minnesota and West Virginia. Florida counts more than 350,000 people living or working in such facilities, and has one of the highest shares of residents over the age of 65.
At the start of the outbreak, Florida deployed rapid-response teams to these facilities to test, treat and, if necessary, isolate or quarantine residents testing positive for the virus. The state issued PPE to these facilities and mandated its use.
While New York was moving sick patients into nursing homes, Florida was moving them out. On March 15, DeSantis prohibited the transfer of COVID-19-positive patients into long-term-care facilities and established COVID-only homes.
By contrast, Gov. Cuomo — celebrated in the media, while DeSantis was pilloried — required that infected patients be admitted into nursing homes, where Cuomo himself had said the virus could spread “like fire through grass.”
Florida’s beaches and businesses are slowly opening, and life is returning to a semblance of normalcy. Retailers and restaurants, hair and nail salons, gyms and hotels are opening with reduced occupancy; soon, “phase two” will allow gatherings of up to 50 people and further loosen occupancy limits. Partly-opened Tampa was among the first US cities to let restaurants extend dining space onto closed streets and open sidewalks, helping them stay in business while preserving social distancing.
Governors should be judged by their states’ records going into and coming out of this crisis. It’s a standard that elevates governors like Ron DeSantis and Bill Lee — and likely condemns Andrew Cuomo.

363,Not your ordinary spa day: Spa chain snags $5.6M in coronavirus relief,https://nypost.com/2020/05/31/spa-chain-snags-5-6-million-in-coronavirus-relief/,2020-05-31 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
A cash-strapped airport spa chain snagged $5.6 million in federal coronavirus aid weeks after warning investors that its independent auditor had raised “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue operating amid hefty losses, The Post has learned.
New York-based XpresSpa told investors it had obtained the Payroll Protection Program loan in a May 7 regulatory filing — just days after its board cut ties with an auditor critical of its business.
XpresSpa didn’t say why it fired CohnReznick, but on April 20 the company revealed the auditor had issued a warning about the state of the company’s financials before the pandemic forced it to shutter its US operations.
“The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,” the company said in the April regulatory filing.
“Our auditors’ doubts are based on our recurring losses from operations and working-capital deficiency.”
XpresSpa operates 51 stores across 25 airports that offer passengers chair massages and mani-pedis. It also sells head pillows and eye masks, according to its Web site.
“XpresSpa was developed to address the stress and idle time spent at the airport, allowing travelers to spend this time productively, by relaxing and focusing on personal care and wellness,” the company said in its annual report.
CEO Doug Satzman says XpresSpa cut ties with CohnReznick because it decided to switch to a less expensive accounting firm, not because of any disagreements. He also said the coronavirus pandemic slammed the company just as it was starting to turn around, noting that comparable store sales rose 2.9 percent last year after dropping 3.2 percent in 2018.
“There’s a lot of cleanup work to do when you do a turnaround,” Satzman told The Post. “… With the PPP loan opportunity, it gave us a tool to use for our workforce who are furloughed to help keep them loyal to us and ready to come back full-time when the airports get busy.”
Yet, before the coronavirus slammed retailers across the nation with coast-to-coast stay-at-home orders, XpresSpa was in the red.
Last year, XpresSpa suffered a $20.5 million net loss as its liabilities dwarfed its assets by some $12.2 million. As of Dec. 31, the company had just $2.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and current assets of $3.9 million. Its current liabilities, by contrast, totaled $16.2 million, including accounts payable and accrued expenses, it said.
“We expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, especially considering the negative impact COVID-19 will have on our liquidity and financial position,” the company said in the filing.
XpresSpa is the latest company to receive a taxpayer-backed loan despite troubles that predated the virus, which has slammed retailers with coast-to-coast stay-at-home orders. Some firms got sizable loans after telling investors they had no products to sell or that they were at risk of running out of cash, according to an Associated Press report.
The government’s $659 billion effort to help small businesses weather the crisis also has been criticised for helping companies that have access to fundraising through public markets at the expense of Main Street operations.
“It’s a gut punch to the tens of thousands of shuttered mom-and-pop small businesses that never received the help they were promised,” blasted Jeremy Funk, spokesman for the nonpartisan corruption watchdog Accountable.US.
XpresSpa has snapped up $9.4 million outside financing in recent months, including $7.9 million from four separate stock offerings in March and April, records show.
In the most recent offering, on April 6, the firm sold $1 million worth of shares to Alpha Capital Anstalt, a Lichtenstein-based hedge fund that came into regulators’ crosshairs two years ago.
Alpha, which didn’t respond to a request for comment, was among nearly two dozen defendants accused in 2018 by the Securities Exchange Commission of participating in a $27 million penny-stock fraud led by disgraced venture capitalist Barry Honig.
Alpha allegedly bought shares in a company at a discount and then sold them after Honig helped inflate the stock price. The fund had to pay $908,000 under a judgment issued last year, though it did not admit any wrongdoing.
XpresSpa is now trying to turn some of its 46 US locations into COVID-19 testing centers for airport workers, which has helped boost the stock price. The stock jumped nearly 70 percent on May 22, for example, after it announced a contract with JFK International Air Terminal to provide a diagnostic COVID-19 testing facility.
Shares of XpresSpa closed at 83 cents on Friday, and the penny stock traded as low as 12 cents in March."

Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) and its pilots union said on Sunday they are working to avoid furloughs of roughly 2,300 pilots following a reshuffling process meant to match staffing to summer 2021 flying.
Delta said this month that it would have more pilots than needed as it reduces its network and fleet due to a drop in demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, but is working to avoid involuntary furloughs.
Following the results on Sunday of a so-called “surplus” bid in which employees were asked to petition available positions at one of Delta’s seven US pilot bases, the airline will be shifting around 7,000 pilots to different locations or aircraft types, while 2,327 have not been assigned to any category, Delta’s Master Executive Council (MEC) of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) said in a statement.
Delta confirmed the release of the results of the bid “to better align our staffing with our future flying demand” and said it is “looking at all options to mitigate or minimize furloughs and will continue working with ALPA in the coming weeks to explore those options.”
Atlanta-based Delta, with around 91,000 employees, announced on Thursday details of early out options for non-union employees that include cash severance, full healthcare coverage and travel benefits.
Major U.S. airlines, which have received billions of dollars in taxpayer aid for payroll, have all warned that they will need to reduce their workforce once a government-imposed ban on job cuts expires on Sept. 30.
After air travel demand virtually disappeared in April, US airline executives have pointed to some green shoots, but the industry is not expected to return to pre-pandemic passenger traffic for at least three years.
ALPA said it was continuing to meet with Delta on potential early-out or voluntary leave programs, saying it is “optimistic that management will continue to engage with ALPA to protect pilot jobs.”"

As told to Ken Davidoff. 
I want to start this week by addressing something much more important than baseball. I don’t normally post anything political or anything about social issues on social media because I tend to listen more than I speak — mainly because I know I don’t have all the answers. But I owe it to all my black teammates and coaches and friends, and other people who have had a huge influence on me over the years, to publicly say that I stand with them in the fight against racism in America.
I think we’re better than this as a country, and what happened to George Floyd was awful and very difficult to watch. Like I said, I don’t have all the answers. I do know that my generation owes it to the world to make sure our kids and our grandkids are taught to never judge anyone by anything other than their character.
I’m still in Oregon, and if you’ve been reading my thoughts here the last couple of months, you know that I’m an optimist about restarting the baseball season. I still think that something can be reached. I still think we’re going to play this year. Under what terms, I don’t know, but I still think we’re going to play.
I’ve been pretty engaged, especially with our team representative Zack Britton (we had been in touch about once a week and now it’s a few times a week) and also with my agents at Beverly Hills Sports Council. I’m trying to share my two cents if I think I could maybe help.
In terms of the negotiations between us and the owners, I don’t bring emotion into it. I don’t think the lack of progress is frustrating at all. To me, it’s just a simple matter of we haven’t yet found an agreement between both sides, so there’s obviously some work to be done.
Meanwhile, I’ve been going strong with my workouts. A lot of the restrictions have been eased in Oregon, so I’ve been able to go to a private gym and do everything there. I’m no longer doing my catching drills in my in-laws’ barn. All this time during the shutdown, I haven’t had to take a break from any sort of workouts or hitting. I’m still in game shape. Not like “game” game shape, but I’m at that peak readiness of where I would be every offseason getting ready to go back to spring training.
When or if we’ll have spring training, we still don’t know. But I remain hopeful that we’ll have it — and a season. And I’ll be ready."
366,Our leaders ignore the high price kids are paying for coronavirus lockdowns,https://nypost.com/2020/06/07/our-leaders-ignore-the-high-price-kids-are-paying-for-lockdowns/,2020-06-07 00:00:00,"The kids are not all right. The isolation and the loneliness of the COVID-19 lockdown hasn’t been good for any of us. We’re on edge and angry at each other. A Gallup poll in April found “the percentages of US adults experiencing significant stress and worry on a daily basis have increased in an unprecedented manner.”
But that’s nothing compared to what many kids have been going through and how they have been dismissed by those in charge.
Kids are resilient, true. But it’s been months of this lockdown. Parents I spoke to feel lied to about how long we would be kept indoors. “It was supposed to be two weeks to stop the spread,” one mom told me. “My kid is getting weird,” three separate parents commented to me.
With no interaction with other kids and no idea when their lives will return to normal, many of the nation’s children are suffering through this lockdown.
Whether their parents are working and shushing them or not working and worrying about when they will again, kids sense their parents’ stress. We can’t pretend it’s not happening.
It doesn’t help that we flipped a switch from “screen time is bad” to “screen time all the time” with hardly any conversation about it. We’ve also done insane things like close green spaces but open streets. In Park Slope, Brooklyn, the turf field at Washington Park remains closed while a street has been opened alongside it. How does this make sense?
More than two weeks ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that, unlike previously thought, the coronavirus actually doesn’t spread easily from surfaces after all. Yet playgrounds remain closed indefinitely.
It’s June, and public pools are closed in many states. This despite the fact that CDC experts say chlorinated water kills the virus. A video of a crowded Memorial Day pool party in Missouri’s Lake of the Ozarks circulated online a few weeks ago. It was meant to terrify us about the COVID spread.
Last week, a Missouri health official announced there were no new coronavirus cases from that pool party. Yet other pools remain shut. For all the talk of following the science, the rules seem arbitrary and not related to science at all.
Meanwhile, in support of the George Floyd protests, epidemiologists like Jennifer Nuzzo make it seem as if staying home was necessary only if you didn’t have a good enough reason for being out. Nuzzo tweeted: “We should always evaluate the risks and benefits of efforts to control the virus. In this moment, the public-health risks of not protesting to demand an end to systemic racism greatly exceed the harms of the virus.”
Any discussion of risks and benefits is brand new. A month ago, if a parent were to wonder if the lockdown was worth it, they would be accused of wanting to “kill Grandma.” But as the protests proceeded, with little if any social distancing, the conversation shifted. Racial justice is important, yes — but other things are important, too.
Kids with special needs have been particularly forgotten during this crisis.
A Queens mom told me her daughter has been getting teletherapy for in lieu of real occupational and physical therapy. “These therapies are very technical. People went to school to learn how to do them, and they’re trying to explain it to me over a computer. It’s like a doctor telling you how to operate … while the patient is running around!”
A mom in Brooklyn told me her son with special needs has not had one instance of live instruction from his teacher. That family is planning to leave New York because they feel so let down by the education system failing their child.
On Friday, Gov. Cuomo finally OK’d in-person special-ed instruction this summer. It’s not enough.
The lockdown has to end and kids need to regain a sense of normalcy before it’s too late.
Studies have already shown that the lockdown has worsened childhood obesity and opened a wider education gap between poor and rich students. A Save the Children survey of 6,000 children in a number of COVID-affected countries found “almost one in four children living under COVID-19 lockdowns, social restrictions and school closures are dealing with feelings of anxiety, with many at risk of lasting psychological distress, including depression” and up to 65 percent struggling with boredom and feelings of isolation.
If we’re evaluating risks and benefits, those risks need to be considered, too. We need to move forward, for our kids and ourselves.

Morris was 61.
“It saddens me to inform you that, after nearly 39 yrs of service to the people of NYC, Chief of Transportation William T. Morris passed away on Saturday from #COVID19,” tweeted Shea. “The condolences and prayers of the entire department are with Billy & his loved ones during this difficult time.”
The tweet included a video tribute to the now 45 NYPD personnel, including Morris, lost to the pandemic, set to the strains of “Amazing Grace” on bagpipes, fading into taps.
Morris, a three-star chief who oversaw traffic and highway patrol, was reportedly placed on life support in April, when the pandemic peaked."

The huge nine-year contract to the not-for-profit firm Public Health Solutions was announced May 27 — the same day Mayor Bill de Blasio revealed that the city faces a $9 billion budget hole because of the economic fallout from COVID-19.
Calling the AIDS contract “very strange,” Queens Councilman Robert Holden, a member of the council’s Health Committee, told The Post, “We’re going through this pandemic.
“A contract of this size over this long period of time should be put on hold,” said the pol, a registered Democrat who was elected as a Republican. “We have a budget shortfall. We shouldn’t be committing this much money long-term that we don’t have.”
On Sunday, the mayor also announced that he will be taking funding from the NYPD to support local youth groups as anti-police-brutality protests rage — a move that Holden said is “all the more reason to put this contract, everything, under the microscope.
“Every agency is going to take a hit,’’ he said of impending budget cuts amid the contagion.
To slash police department funding during such a time of unrest is “lunacy’’ and “not rational thinking.’’
The mayor did not say how much NYPD funding would be diverted to the local youth groups or when, explaining that those details would be worked out in coming weeks during budget talks.
His office did not immediately respond to Holden’s comments.
The Health Department contract comes as the city is recording historic lows in new HIV diagnoses, according to an agency report in November.
The department said that in 2018, the city figure “fell below 2,000 for the first time since annual HIV reporting began in 2001.
“According to the 2018 HIV Surveillance Annual Report, 1,917 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in New York City in 2018, down 11% from the 2,157 new diagnoses reported in 2017, and down 67% from 2001,’’ it said.
Asked about the new HIV/AIDS contract, department spokesman Patrick Gallahue told The Post in a statement, “This is the master contract for HIV services.
“PHS will be responsible for the procurement, subcontracting and management of a portfolio of human service contracts going to various providers across the city.
“Through the subcontracts, most of the $1.2B will be passed onto community-based social service providers for the provision of services to prevent new HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections, to decrease morbidity and mortality among individuals with HIV, to prevent/respond to the outbreak of infectious diseases in New York City, and to ensure and promote the health of New Yorkers.’’
PHS has been awarded government contracts in the past to improve health outcomes in low-income and immigrant neighborhoods by helping enroll people for health insurance, providing more nutritious food options and curbing smoking.
A spokeswoman for Public Health Solutions referred questions to the city Health Department.
The contract runs from Sept. 1, 2020, to Aug. 31, 2029.

369,New York City reopens under Phase One on Monday,https://nypost.com/2020/06/07/new-york-city-re-opens-under-phase-one-on-monday/,2020-06-07 00:00:00,"The Big Apple will enter Phase One of reopening Monday amid the coronavirus — with retail shops set to start curbside or in-store pickup service as construction and manufacturing rev up again.
“It’s a big day for New York City,’’ Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday, adding that the Apple “has met all the [health] metrics,’’ including the one involving its number of new infections, which dropped to 781 cases, or around 1 percent of those tested, Saturday — the lowest rate since March 16.
The city’s subways should be at 95 percent of their pre-pandemic service by Monday to help get people around, officials have said. Masks are required and will be handed out to straphangers as needed, although ridership is expected to be no more than 15 percent of its usual level.
New York City is the final region in the state to go to Phase One.
In addition to retail curbside service and in-store pickups and drop-offs, construction is allowed to resume, as is manufacturing, wholesale trade and agriculture work under the state guidelines.
Retail industry groups have predicted a trickling of city businesses starting up again Monday, as they begin to maneuver the new normal of social distancing and heightened health concerns amid the deadly pandemic.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday that he is still “cautious’’ about moving into Phase Two, which would allow many workers to return to their offices, restaurants and bars to offer outdoor seated service, retail shops to operate in-store business and other places such as hair salons to reopen, although at 50 percent capacity.
While Phase Two could occur as soon as two weeks from Monday, or June 22, under state guidelines, Hizzoner repeated that he wasn’t ready to commit to that date, instead saying, “Think about the beginning of July as the target.
“I want to keep expectations low on that,” he said of Phase Two.
“We are not like other regions of the state. We were the epicenter, and we remain the epicenter,” the mayor said.
“If we don’t like what we see, we are going to slow down the pace,” he said of the reopening schedule. “If we do like what we see, we might be able to go a little faster.”
He added that a decision on when to restart the city’s famed outdoor street fairs has not yet been made.
Meanwhile, Cuomo said Long Island will move into Phase Two on Wednesday, while the Hudson Valley gets to go to Phase Three on Tuesday, which means such things as in-restaurant dining.
Phase Four allows for the reopening of places including schools, movie theaters and museums.
Among the factors governing phases are such things as infection, hospitalization and death rates."

“We have got to get this vaccine done. Unfortunately we have evidence that communist China is trying to sabotage us or slow it down,” Scott of Florida said Sunday on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show.”
Scott, who was previously the governor of Florida, didn’t offer evidence of the claim, but noted that he can’t share all intelligence he sees.
“It came to our intelligence community. I’m on [the Senate Armed Services Committee], so clearly there’s things I can’t discuss that I get provided information [on]. But there’s evidence that they’ve been trying to either sabotage or slow it down,” Scott said.
He said Beijing “won’t cheer” if the US or the United Kingdom are first to develop a vaccine.
The ruling Communist Party has “decided to be an adversary to Americans and I think to democracy around the world,” he said.
Scott said the vaccine is important to getting the US economy back and that if China develops it first, “they are not going to share.”
President Trump has been highly critical of China’s role in the pandemic, accusing the country of not releasing accurate information in a timely manner so other countries could take precautions against the coronavirus.
The virus was first recorded in Wuhan, China, in late December."

The country with the second highest death toll is the United Kingdom, with more than 40,500 people dead so far from the contagion.
World health officials have warned that the actual fatality figures are likely higher, since many people who have died were never tested for the virus.
Globally, more than 6.9 million people have been infected with the virus — more than 1.9 million of them in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins.

“We’ve seen too many officers who just have [masks] off, and it’s painful to people because it feels like they’re flouting the rules,” he said during a press conference Sunday, calling it a “human decency thing” amid the ongoing threat from the contagion.
“It frustrates me to no end. We have to do better in the NYPD,” de Blasio complained, saying he had confronted NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea to insist his officers start adhering to the safety rules.
“I would say to all the officers out there, I know you have a hard job, but do unto others,” Hizzoner said at a virtual press briefing.
“If we’re asking everyone else to follow the rules — social distancing, wear a face covering — you should do it too,” he said.
Police previously ought with the de Blasio administration over the availability of masks — with health commissioner Oxiris Barbot reportedly telling NYPD chief Terrence Monahan that she didn’t give “two rats’ asses” about NYPD cops’ need for masks.
She eventually apologized and hundreds of thousands of surgical masks were provided to the NYPD — though photos and witness reports indicate they rarely wore them during protest activity, including Monahan himself.
Hizzoner conceded that there may at times be a “legitimate, tactical reason” for officers having to temporarily remove their masks — ones the department had to fight to get in the first place.
“That’s not the only thing we’ve seen,” he stressed, noting that many were simply shrugging off safety because it was hot and the masks can be uncomfortable for long stretches of time.
“Too often it looks like it’s being ignored and that’s not acceptable,” he said.
“I’ve had this conversation with the commissioner — I expect to see improvement in this area.”"

Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that the state will open 15 coronavirus testing centers solely for protesters — urging marchers to “act responsibly and get a test” amid concerns that the large anti-police-brutality rallies sweeping New York City are spreading the deadly contagion.
With the Big Apple finally set to begin re-opening under Phase One of state guidelines Monday amid the pandemic, officials are worried that the large local protests over George Floyd’s death at the hands of cops in Minneapolis could send New York’s coronavirus cases soaring again, the governor said.
“That is the one variable in this [coronavirus] equation that we’re not sure of — the effect of these protests, and we’re concerned about it,” Cuomo said at his daily press briefing.
“I would act as if you were exposed, and I would tell people you interacted with, ‘Assume I’m exposed to the virus,’ ” Cuomo said of the protesters.
He said the state will be looking at the infection rate “on a daily basis” to see whether re-openings might have to be pulled back.
He said it will likely take a week to see whether the rallies had any substantial effect on the spread of COVID-19.
“If you were at a protest several days ago, [infection] probably wouldn’t show up [now], but when you get at seven days, you will start to see a pop in those numbers” if the protests caused the disease to spread, Cuomo said.
“If you were at a protest … act responsibly, get a test,” he said.
Cuomo added that as of Saturday, statistics show that “overall, numbers are good” when it comes to the state’s battle against the coronavirus.
He said 781 people, or about 1 percent, tested positive for the virus in the state Saturday out of the 60,435 people were received testing that day — the lowest rate since March 16, even before the state began closing down."
374,Fauci: China ‘did a disservice’ by withholding coronavirus info,https://nypost.com/2020/06/07/fauci-china-did-a-disservice-by-withholding-coronavirus-info/,2020-06-07 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert, said China did a “disservice” by not allowing scientists to speak transparently about the coronavirus in the early days of the pandemic.
“I think the Chinese authorities that did not allow the scientists to speak out as openly and transparently as they could really did a disservice,” Fauci told John Catsimatidis on his AM 970 radio show on Sunday.
Fauci said if Chinese scientists had been able to sound the alarm earlier about person-to-person transmission of the virus, the number of cases worldwide could have been reduced.
“Because at the beginning of the outbreak, they were claiming that this was just animal-to-human transmission,” he said.
“And there really wasn’t a human-to-human transmission at all. And they held that line for a few weeks. And then it became very clear when the scientists were able to talk about it, that, in fact, there was human-to-human transmission. … Yes, it’s another example of the unfortunate situation of lack of transparency early on,” Fauci said.
President Trump has ripped China for not warning the world about the severity of the virus after the first cases were reported in Wuhan in late December and then not being transparent about the number of infected in the country.
He also accused China of using its influence with the World Health Organization to delay crucial real-time reporting about the pandemic.
A report last week said China held back on providing the WHO with full data on patients and cases and did not release a genetic map of the virus until more than a week after three other labs had decoded it.
The report by the Associated Press said the genetic data delay slowed the development of a vaccine and the lack of concise information about the number of cases made it difficult to determine how quickly COVID-19 was spreading around the world.
There are nearly 7 million coronavirus cases around the world and more than 400,000 have died of the virus."
375,Tulsa health director ‘wishes’ Trump would reschedule rally amid coronavirus spike,https://nypost.com/2020/06/14/tulsa-health-director-wants-trump-to-reschedule-rally-over-coronavirus/,2020-06-14 00:00:00,"The director of Tulsa’s Health Department said he “wishes” President Trump would reschedule Saturday’s campaign rally as the city experiences an uptick in coronavirus cases.
“I think it’s an honor for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic,” said Director Bruce Dart in an interview with the Tulsa World on Saturday.
“I’m concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and I’m also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well.”
Dart said Tulsa is seeing a “significant increase in our case trends” that he believes could put attendees and the president at risk.
Oklahoma reported its highest daily number of new coronavirus cases on Friday, when 223 positive tests were reported — only to have that record broken the next day when another 224 new cases were reported Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
“COVID is here in Tulsa, it is transmitting very efficiently,” Dart told the outlet. “I wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isn’t as large a concern as it is today.”
The rise of new COVID-19 patients has otherwise spiked and dropped from day to day, not previously surpassed 171 new cases for a single 24 hours. Dart told the paper that the recent jump wasn’t from increased testing — which has remained constant in recent weeks — but likely from “quarantine fatigue” and large private events.
“People are not staying home now, they’re out and about,” Dart added. “I completely understand that, staying closed just wasn’t feasible economically and from an emotional, physical perspective.”
Trump has drawn criticism from Democrats for holding the event during the pandemic, and also for originally planning the rally for on June 19, the Juneteenth holiday.
The president relented on the latter point and tweeted late Friday that the rally would be moved back a day, to Saturday, June 20. He said pushed the rally back out of respect for the date that marks the day when news that President Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation reached Texas, the last state where slaves learned of their freedom.
All attendees are required to sign a sign coronavirus disclaimer stating that they bear all responsibility if they catch the coronavirus."
376,Sushi restaurateur swims past pandemic mayhem with thriving sales,https://nypost.com/2020/06/14/sushi-restaurateur-swims-past-pandemic-mayhem-with-thriving-sales/,2020-06-14 00:00:00,"The coronavirus pandemic has been strangely good to New York City restaurateur Garry Kanfer.
At a time when most Big Apple eateries are struggling to survive, Manhattan sushi restaurant Kissaki has been thriving, according to Kanfer — thanks to some pointed business decisions like importing fish directly from Japan, making a takeout-friendly menu, and investing in sushi-making robots.
The bold moves have paid off in spades, allowing Kanfer to open a second outpost on East 54 Street in the midst of the mayhem. He plans to launch a third location in the Hamptons on Thursday.
It’s an unexpected turnaround for the Lower East Side Kissaki, which only opened its doors in January as an eatery focused on the luxurious but costly Japanese tradition of letting a chef choose the meal — known as omakase. When the pandemic forced Gotham restaurants to close their dine-in operations in mid-March, Kissaki wasn’t exactly the go-to option for takeout.
That started to change on May 1, however, when Kissaki launched a takeout-friendly menu. In addition to omakase courses that can run as high as $147, the restaurant pivoted with items like donburi bowls of rice and fish for $20.
By mid-May, Kissaki was raking in around $55,000 a week — close to what it was earning pre-pandemic, Kanfer says.
The serial entrepreneur and former financial analyst also started sourcing his own fish directly from Japan, which has resulted in significant cost savings.
“We have been importing direct from Japan with no distributors. The fish leaves Tokyo, clears JFK the same night and is in the restaurants the next day — much fresher than having it sit in a distributor’s warehouse,” he says.
The blackthroat seaperch, or rosy seabass, that used to cost $65 to $85 a pound, for example, is now $25 a pound, and Kinmedai, aka splendid alfonsino, goes for $24 a pound instead of $32, while bluefin tuna is $12 a pound, down from $20. In addition, Kanfer claims he has access to some fish that distributors stopped getting during COVID-19, like Hotate scallops.
“They’re not even available through distributors because of COVID. We used to pay $50 for a pack of 12 pieces and now we pay around $40,” he says, adding he also saves on Hokkaido uni trays.
What’s more, the new sushi robotics have slashed labor costs — while keeping production humming during a time when employees were wary of coming to work because of health and safety concerns.
The robots, which look more like a heavy kitchen appliance than something out of “Star Wars,” are used to roll nigiri rice balls “delicately, without crushing the rice grains,” Kanfer says. He’s also invested in maki-making machines that produce sheets of rice of various thickness at a pace of up to 1,300 sheets per hour.
The equipment sales came with a coronavirus discount of 15 percent to 20 percent, or around $12,500 each.
Kissaki’s second location is based inside Greek restaurant Nerai, which has resorted to a profit-sharing model during COVID-19 to make use of its three-story space. All the restaurants contribute to rent.
The next move, Kanfer said, is the Hamptons. “A lot of our customers are in the Hamptons for the summer. First, because of COVID, and now because of the protests. We feel there are more people in the Hamptons than ever — and that’s where we needed to be.”
He opened a place in Water Mill, formerly home to Mirko’s. Takeout opens this week and outdoor dining is slated for the end of the month.
“Thank God our takeout model worked,” Kanfer said. “It is definitely a great, positive story.”"
377,PGA Tour aces coronavirus return in what was weird week,https://nypost.com/2020/06/14/charles-schwab-challenge-pga-tour-aces-coronavirus-return/,2020-06-14 00:00:00,"FORT WORTH, Texas — Well, it worked.
The PGA Tour pulled it off, conducting its first tournament after a three-month hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic, and it was done safely and successfully.
For one week at least, the mission was accomplished.
It was the first mainstream American professional sporting event that has been staged since the pandemic put a pause to every sport back in March.
And, other than the lack of 25,000 spectators per day and a few good parties in the corporate tents around the grounds, the Charles Schwab Challenge and Colonial Country Club could not have delivered any better this week.
Make no mistake: This event was a guinea pig, a test balloon — not just for golf but for every professional league preparing to restart its season as we all try to move forward in search of whatever the new normalcy will be.
The success this week began with all 148 players and their caddies testing negative for COVID-19, and it ended with a compelling final-round shootout, with Daniel Berger winning in a playoff and slipping on the signature tartan blazer that comes with victory at Colonial.
At the end of the day, though, with all kudos going to Berger, the most important end game to the week was not who won, but the fact this event safely arrived to the finish line and now the tour may move on with confidence to this week’s RBC Heritage Championship at Hilton Head, S.C.
“I think it’s gone about as well as we could have hoped for,’’ PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said Sunday. “There’s more work to be done. This is about a sustained return. But I think as we sit here late in the day on Sunday, there’s no question that this has been an exceptional week.’’
Monahan was asked if the overriding emotion from the week is relief or excitement, and he said, “I think it’s a sense of excitement. [But] you can’t have one without the other, I guess, in this environment.’’
What kept him up at night leading into this historic restart?
“I think the biggest concern, given the amount of time that we put into our testing and safety protocols, was that even though we felt really good about the plan we had in place, if we saw the number of tests that were positive or we got into a situation where we were dealing with a number of positive tests, that’s something, candidly, that I lost a lot of sleep over in the weeks that preceded coming in there,’’ Monahan said. “A lot of challenges, but I would say that would probably have been the biggest concern because it’s the one that we’ve all been dealing with, wrestling with, trying to understand and trying to prepare for.’’
It was an historic, weird and sometimes moving week.
“I would say it’s hard to pick a favorite moment because there’s so many along the way,’’ Monahan said. “I think just everybody being back together and being on property on Thursday, recognizing that the PGA Tour was returning, and to see our players back together.
“It’s almost like when you went away for school for the summer and then you come back in the fall, those first couple days, seeing people that you haven’t seen in a while. That was the thing that was, to me, really, really powerful and meaningful. And, then when you add on top of it the 8:46 moment [the vacated tee time moment of silence to recognize the George Floyd tragedy]. Thursday morning was really, really a meaningful moment.’’
Bubba Watson said he didn’t think the PGA Tour “can do any better’’ than it did this week.
“It’s exciting to be playing again,’’ runner-up Collin Morikawa said. “There [were] going to be people that range from all different points of view, whether they’re afraid, whether they’re not afraid, and how do you put everyone together and have a balanced field of you’ve got to do this, you’ve got to do everything.
“Everyone went through the testing, everyone did what they needed to do. We still have to follow these guidelines and maintain safety and strict rules with how far we stay from each other because it’s still out there.
“Obviously, we don’t know how bad it is at any given moment. We don’t know who has it, if they have it, whether they’re symptomatic, asymptomatic. We just have to be cognizant of what’s around us and where we put ourselves because we want the Tour to keep playing. We want to keep playing.’’"

Sunbathers flocked to Central Park’s Sheep Meadow to catch some rays on a gorgeous Sunday, but many opted not to cover their faces — or much else, for that matter — despite the ongoing pandemic.
Several among the thongs — er, throngs — stripped down to their skivvies to let the sunshine near where it don’t shine.
But while going pantsless was simply a bold fashion choice, those who forswore masks and blew off social-distancing guidelines were flouting a state mandate put in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

No one really knows the odds of a second coronavirus wave as the nation leaves lockdown, but the best bet is that it depends on how people behave.
Some states are seeing a rise in cases, which just crossed the 2 million mark nationwide. That’s most often a reflection of more testing. But Arizona, for one, seems to be seeing an increase in the percentage of tests that come back positive — and that’s true in scattered other areas, too.
Overall, though, new cases nationally last week grew at the slowest rate since March. And many predictions of doom are falling far short: Pundits were sure Florida’s restart, with even salons and gyms reopening, would lead to disaster. Hmm: Cases there have risen about 28 percent in the last two weeks — but testing is up 37 percent, so the key rate is falling.
Most important, the national rates of hospitalizations and deaths also continue downward. Just nine states are seeing their rates tick up. Texas, despite an increase in hospitalizations, is still seeing its death rate go down. So is Florida.
Many experts point to data on how humidity, sunlight and breezes seem to affect the virus’ spread and see reason for some optimism as summer starts — and renewed caution come the fall.
For now: Food and Drug Administration chief Stephen Hahn says the White House Coronavirus Task Force hasn’t found any correlation between reopening and increased cases. Some states have reopened and seen no spike — Colorado, for example. And things vary within states: Los Angeles County had more than half of California’s new cases last week, while San Francisco had no new cases for three straight days.
Eric Toner, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, believes some of that variation is simply random luck — while some can be attributed to differing standards on hygiene and social distancing.
Hence the real bottom line: It’s up to each of us and all of us to maintain social distancing and wear face masks when we can’t, wash hands obsessively — and, yes, avoid large crowds.
Now more than ever, the country’s health is in its people’s hands."

“Craziness,” is how 20-year-old student Charlotte Power described the scene. “Dancing, partying. Hopefully no fights.”
New Zealand on Saturday became one of the first nations in the world to welcome hordes of fans back into a packed sports stadium, thanks to the country’s remarkable success in eliminating the coronavirus.
As countries try to reopen after lockdowns, the evening rugby match marked a milestone of sorts, and its importance wasn’t lost on fans.
After instituting a strict lockdown in March, New Zealand has not reported any new cases of the coronavirus for more than three weeks, and says all those who contracted the disease have now recovered. Earlier in the week, the country removed just about every remaining virus restriction, with the notable exception of keeping the border closed.
That meant there were no masks or social distancing required when more than 20,000 fans poured into the Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin to watch Saturday’s match between the local Highlanders and the Chiefs, who had traveled from Hamilton.
“It’s massive,” the country’s sports minister, Grant Robertson, said on the sidelines. “It’s a world first and it’s a payoff for all the hard work of 5 million New Zealanders.”
Robertson said he’s been fielding calls from India and beyond from people curious to know how professional sports can proceed without virus restrictions. He said there’s something special about being at a game.
New Zealand welcomed back sports with fans. The country hasn't had any new COVID-19 cases in three weeks.

“Anyone who’s a fan of live sport or even live music knows that if you’re there, it’s totally different,” he said.
For fan Iki Uele, it was a pleasure just seeing all the people.
“Everyone has been dying for this moment,” he said. “Being locked down, we just needed something to vent out.”
Uele said he did have concerns that somebody in the crowd might have the virus without knowing it. But he was willing to take the chance.
German exchange student Johanna Lindner said she’d never watched a rugby match before, and people back home were both curious and perhaps a little envious.
“It’s a great opportunity to socialize again,” she said. “To bring the country together since New Zealand is turning into one bubble. I think it’s really important to lift people’s mood a little bit.”
Peter Miskimmin, the chief executive of government agency Sport New Zealand, said the return of stadium games is enormously significant, and that sports are part of the nation’s DNA.
“I don’t think anyone has yet replicated that sense of excitement of being in a crowd, and the passions that flow from that,” he said. “To be in a stadium and to feel it, and to even influence the game. The players know that the crowd is there.”
Taiwan’s professional baseball league began allowing a very limited number of fans into games in May, but loosened restrictions last weekend after the government eased coronavirus measures. Fans no longer have to wear masks when they’re seated, food and drinks are now allowed in the stands, and stadiums can be filled up to half capacity.
During Saturday’s rugby match, the momentum, and the lead, swung back and forth. The crowd got a laugh and a break from the mounting tension when a streaker wearing nothing but shoes braved the frigid winter weather and burst across the field. Then, with 2 minutes left on the clock, the home team scored a go-ahead drop goal.
As the final hooter sounded and the Highlanders kicked out the ball to win 28-27, the fans screamed and hugged. The players slapped each other on their backs and embraced.
All thoughts of social distancing were long gone."
381,Florida scientist makes own COVID-19 map after refusing to doctor state data,https://nypost.com/2020/06/14/florida-scientist-axed-for-not-altering-covid-19-map-makes-her-own/,2020-06-14 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
A Florida data scientist who claimed she was fired by the state for not doctoring coronavirus figures released her own COVID-19 map.
Former state Department of Health worker Rebekah Jones said she was fired because she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.”
So now the enterprising Sunshine Stater has created her own map, similar to Florida’s version, except for one major additional detail: Her map includes report cards for each county on whether they meet the state’s criteria for entering the next phase of reopening.
Jones told NPR she hopes to give people a source of trusted information untainted by the politics of reopening.
“I think I’m uniquely equipped to try to help with that,” she said, “so that’s what I’m doing. I just don’t want people to panic. I don’t want anybody to feel afraid or powerless.”
By Jones’ calculations, only four of Florida’s 67 counties are ready to loosen coronavirus restrictions.
She has said she tried to add the report cards to the state’s own data portal, but health department officials made her drop the feature when they realized it cast the state’s progress in a negative light.
“When I went to show them what the report card would say for each county, among other things, they asked me to delete the report card because it showed that no counties, pretty much, were ready for reopening,” she told NPR. “And they didn’t want to draw attention to that.”
A superior asked her to go into the data behind its map and alter the numbers so that the state’s coronavirus positivity rating would change from 18 percent to 10 percent, making the state appear to meet its reopening target.
Florida entered Phase One of its reopening on May 4, in all counties except Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. It eased restrictions again on June 5 when the state declared the counties had entered Phase Two.
But the state is now among more than a dozen experiencing a marked resurgence in cases.
Already among the hardest-hit states in the country, Florida registered more than 2,500 new cases in a 24-hour window from Friday to Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins. It’s registered more than 75,000 confirmed cases and nearly 3,000 deaths.
Jones has attributed the state’s shady behavior to incompetence rather than active conspiracy.
“To me, it did not read like some kind of political conspiracy or some higher directive,” Jones says. “It seemed like people who expected when I brought in those results, the results to support the plan they had written, and they did not, they seemed panicked, and like they had to figure out a way to make the results match the plan.”
Florida’s Department of Health did not respond to a Post request for comment."
382,Ohio State football players must sign coronavirus risk waiver,https://nypost.com/2020/06/14/ohio-state-football-players-must-sign-coronavirus-risk-waiver/,2020-06-14 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Ohio State is protecting itself.
The powerhouse football program began bringing players back to campus last week for voluntary workouts and the student-athletes were required to agree to a coronavirus risk waiver, the Columbus Dispatch reported.
The school isn’t releasing any of its testing results for the virus, citing medical privacy concerns, even as Oklahoma State, Alabama and Houston have done so. At least eight Alabama players reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus, as well as three Oklahoma State players.
“From a functional perspective of trying to curtail an epidemic, it’s helpful for the public to know that this is going on even among the members of their beloved football team,” Michael Saag, an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, told The Dispatch. “I think there’s some utilitarian benefit from a public-health standpoint.”
The Ohio State document was referred to as the “Buckeye Pledge,” as players were asked to “pledge to take responsibility for my own health and help stop the spread of the COVID-19.”
It also warned players that “although the university is following the coronavirus guidelines issued by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and other experts to reduce the spread of infection, I can never be completely shielded from all risk of illness caused by COVID-19 or other infections.”
Players who declined to sign it would not be allowed to take part in team activities or use facilities on campus, though their scholarships would remain intact. It’s unclear whether any players declined to sign the waiver.
Incoming freshmen not yet 18 years old were required to have a parent or legal guardian sign the waiver.
According to the pledge, Ohio State players have to adhere to coronavirus testing guidelines, report being exposed to the virus, disclose any symptoms of the virus they may be suffering from and stay home if they feel sick. The school said it leaned on the CDC and Ohio Department of Health to come up with its guidelines.
Ohio State isn’t the only school to require players to sign a document in which they agree to follow certain health guidelines. Indiana student-athletes have to sign a waiver as well before returning to workouts next week."

The coronavirus induced lockdown in England should not be further lifted until the government’s contact-tracing system proves to be “robust and effective,” the World Health Organization’s regional European director Hans Kluge said.
In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Kluge also cautioned that Britain remained in a “very active phase of the pandemic” and warned against rushing into reopening the economy.
Britain said on Sunday it was reviewing its two-metre (6.5-foot) social distancing rule ahead of the next stage of lockdown easing planned for July 4.
England’s test and trace system identified nearly 32,000 people who had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19 in its first week of operation, but the government admitted that the system is not perfect and would need to do better.
“Contact tracing is key especially as the UK starts to relax the social and physical distancing measures. There has to be a robust track-and-trace system in place of operation,” Kluge told the Guardian.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government, which has faced heavy criticism for its handling of the pandemic, has touted the system as the way to ease lockdown measures while keeping the coronavirus spread in check.
Britain has reported 41,698 coronavirus-related deaths as of 4 p.m. GMT on June 13, third highest in the world after the United States and Brazil, according to government data."

“We are working rather smoothly and emerging from this situation with the coronavirus confidently and, with minimal losses. … But in the (United) States that is not happening,” Putin told state TV.
Putin said Moscow’s response was more coordinated than Washington’s because Russian authorities worked in unity.
“I can’t imagine someone in the (Russian) government or regions saying we are not going to do what the government or president say,” said Putin.
“It seems to me that the problem (in the United States) is that group, in this case party interests, are put above those of society’s as a whole, above the interests of the people.”
Russia, according to Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus map, has the third-highest reported number of cases in the world, with 528,267.
It’s behind Brazil with 850,514 cases and the US with 2,083,082 cases.
Russia’s official death toll is 6,938, compared with America’s 115,578 — but its tallies have been met with skepticism.
It almost doubled its official fatality numbers for April on Saturday after the World Health Organization questioned how low it seemed, according to the Washington Post.

385,Gov. Cuomo cautiously touts New York’s progress in coronavirus battle,https://nypost.com/2020/06/14/gov-cuomo-cautiously-touts-new-yorks-coronavirus-progress/,2020-06-14 00:00:00,"New York is making “really great progress’’ in its fight against the coronavirus, registering the lowest number of daily deaths since the pandemic started — but that doesn’t mean it’s out of the woods, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.
“Those numbers can change in a week … and once they change, you can’t change them back that quickly,’’ the governor said, noting other states’ struggles with rising figures.
There were 23 coronavirus deaths reported in New York on Saturday and an increase of 1.1 percent in new positive cases of the contagion, the governor said. Seventeen of the deaths were in hospitals and six in nursing homes.
At the height of the pandemic, New York was registering around 800 deaths a day, and nearly 50 percent of those tested were positive for the virus.
New York City’s daily infection rate was down to 1.4 percent, although the figure for the borough of Staten Island was 2.9 percent, the highest for it in five days. It was at a low of 1.1 percent Friday before jumping up the next day.
“That can be a Saturday aberration, but we’re watching it,” the governor said of Staten Island’s situation.
Otherwise, “we breathe a sigh of relief today,” the governor said. “Today is another great day for New Yorkers.”
Still, he warned Manhattan and the Hamptons on Long Island that if their residents don’t begin to social-distance better — with the local governments cracking down on scofflaws — he would shut them down again.
Cuomo added that he is extending enrollment in the state’s healthcare exchange by another 30 days.
He said it’s still unclear what college learning in the state will look like this fall."
386,Surgeon general says wearing masks will give Americans ‘more freedom’,https://nypost.com/2020/06/14/surgeon-general-jerome-adams-urges-americans-to-wear-masks/,2020-06-14 00:00:00,"Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Sunday encouraged people to wear a mask to stop the spread of the coronavirus — saying the face coverings don’t infringe on Americans’ “freedom” and will help to get the economy up and running.
“Some feel face coverings infringe on their freedom of choice- but if more wear them, we’ll have MORE freedom to go out. Face coverings [leads to] less asymptomatic viral spread [leads to] more places open, and sooner!” Adams wrote on Twitter.
“Exercise and promote your freedom by choosing to wear a face covering!”
The surgeon general had originally said in February that masks are “not effective” to prevent transmission, and urged people to protect themselves by staying home when they are sick and washing their hands thoroughly with soap and water.
He changed his tune in early April after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines that Americans should wear face-coverings in public.
Nevertheless, orders to wear face masks have been met with resistance in some parts of the country.
During a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan last month, President Trump donned a mask but took it off before he met with workers.
Asked why he wasn’t seen in the mask, he said, “I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.”"
387,Ten percent of Rikers inmates re-arrested after coronavirus release: NYPD,https://nypost.com/2020/06/14/ten-percent-of-rikers-inmates-released-over-coronavirus-re-arrested/,2020-06-14 00:00:00,"Some 10 percent of those cut free from Rikers Island due to coronavirus concerns since March have since been arrested — some multiple times, The Post has learned.
Out of the roughly 2,500 inmates let go from the city’s largest jail, 250 have used the freedom to allegedly commit nearly 450 new crimes, NYPD data obtained by The Post shows.
One of the released inmates used his freedom to break into the hotel room of an out-of-state doctor who had flown up from Texas to help with the COVID pandemic.
Ronaldo Lewis was arrested May 26 on charges he swiped around $11,000 in various items from the doctor.
The 29-year-old man was previously cut free on May 6 while he awaited trial for allegedly using a sock stuffed with a heavy object to steal $1,000 from a Manhattan T-Mobile store, sources said.
Police sources said cops have a “good case” in the May 23 incident at the Brooklyn Hotel on Atlantic Avenue near Nostrand Avenue in Crown Heights.
“He’s on video going into the room… He IDs himself in the video and when we arrest him he had the doctor’s bag,” the source said.
“But he gets [released] for that and he’s back out again,” the source griped.
“Nobody is going into Rikers and everyone is coming out,” the same source fumed.
Then there’s 27-year-old Jonathan Martinez, who has been arrested and let go pending trial three times since his COVID-related release on March 16 — most recently for hurling a brick through a bodega window on June 6 and allegedly stealing socks, according to WNBC-TV.
He was also arrested for allegedly using a box cutter to rob someone of a phone in March and for allegedly stealing food from a high-end Manhattan grocery store in April, the outlet said.
The Legal Aid Society told WNBC that Martinez was initially released in March because prosecutors were not prepared to move forward with that case — in which he was accused of robbing a make-up store, according to the report.
Another one of the criminal justice frequent fliers was Seth Shaquan — a Bronx man with more than 30 arrests on domestic calls and nearly 60 misdemeanor convictions, sources said.
Shaquan pleaded guilty to criminal contempt on March 20 after ignoring multiple orders of protection by demanding to see his kids in late February, court records show.
The Bronx DA tried to get Shaquan in a drug-treatment program but after the coronavirus shut down the court, the man was given a one year conditional discharged due to COVID concerns, records and sources show.
Shaquan then continued to harass his ex-girlfriend over the five children, police sources said.
On May 2, Shaquan broke into his ex’s apartment and stole two TVs, clothes and other items, according to the criminal complaint.
The Bronx District Attorney requested a $10,000 bail, but Judge Audrey Stone was released him on his own recognizance, according to court records.
“He should never have been ROR-ed on May 5… It’s not only about who’s coming out it’s who’s not going in,” one police source griped.
A judge eventually locked Shaquan up on May 16 after he returned to harass his ex three more times in the night, according to the criminal complaint. He was held on $20,000 bail."

“The $600 plus-up that’s above the state unemployment benefits they will continue to receive is in effect a disincentive. I mean, we’re paying people not to work. It’s better than their salaries would get,” Kudlow said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“That might have worked for the first couple of months. It will end in late July,” Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, added.
The weekly boost to the unemployment checks included in the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill, which Trump signed into law in March, will expire on July 31.
Kudlow said the Trump administration is looking at other alternatives, including a bonus for “returning to work, but it will not be as large, and it will create an incentive to work.”
He said the economy is at a turning point following the months-long lockdown because of the pandemic.
“I think we are on our way. We are reopening, businesses are coming back and therefore jobs are coming back,” Kudlow said. “We don’t want to interfere with that process.”
Host Jake Tapper pressed Kudlow about the contention that the checks are a disincentive and suggested that many of the jobs lost will not be coming back.
“I think that’s a fair point. I personally agree with you. I think people want to go back to work. I think they welcome the reopening of the economy. I think they’re anxious to get out and about,” Kudlow said."

Dr. Anthony Fauci says the US will likely not return to life resembling “real normality” during the coronavirus pandemic until next year, according to a report.
“I would hope to get to some degree of real normality within a year or so. But I don’t think it’s this winter or fall,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The Telegraph on Sunday.
Fauci said that he anticipates a few cycles of the virus “coming back and forth” before the country is able to return to normal.
“We were successful in suppressing the virus in cities where there were major outbreaks – New York, Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans,” he told the newspaper. “But we’re seeing several states, as they try to reopen and get back to normal, starting to see early indications [that] infections are higher than previously.”
He said that without measures to contain the virus, the states are at risk of experiencing a “full-blown” outbreak.
“The question is will they have the capability to do the appropriate and effective isolation, and contact tracing, to prevent this increase from becoming a full-blown outbreak?” Fauci said. “I’m concerned it’s happening. I hope the individual states can blunt that. It [the virus] could go on for a couple of cycles, coming back and forth.”
But Fauci was optimistic that there’s an end in sight to the pandemic, noting there were several potential vaccines in the works.
“This will end. As stressful and devastating as it is, it will end,” Fauci told the newspaper. “We are all in it together as a global community, and I do see the light at the end of the tunnel.”"

So how does he think the team should celebrate this season (if there is one) in the coronavirus?
Alonso, a guest with Gary Cohen, Ron Darling, Keith Hernandez and Steve Gelbs on SNY’s “Beyond the Booth Live” recently, was asked best way the team should celebrate in a social-distancing acceptable way.
“I mean, is that a rule?” Alonso asked when the issue was brought to his attention. “I don’t want to put myself in a bind, because I don’t know if we’re going to get fined or something like that, but how are we going to celebrate a walk-off being six feet apart?”
After struggling to come with an immediate answer — calling it a “head scratcher” — the 25-year-old first baseman eventually produced a cool answer after some prompting from Gelbs.
Gelbs brought up an idea of his teammate Dominic Smith, which he previously threw out there during a previous SNY show. Smith’s proposed using a selfie-stick-like contraption to still pull the jerseys off.
Alonso’s idea may have beaten it, though.
“Or what we should do is like use the hose to spray the person down, like the field crew hose,” Alonso said. “I don’t know.”
Though Alonso hasn’t been playing, he’s been contributing a lot a lot off the field during the coronavirus pandemic supporting frontline workers. He also has added his support to a growing list of athletes decrying the death of 46-year-old George Floyd and supporting the Black Lives Matters movement and pushing for greater racial justice and the end of police brutality.
Alonso, who said the Mets are a close-knit group, also is hoping to get back on the field soon.
“It’s a close-knit group, and I’m ready to get back after it,” Alonso said. “All of us pull for each other and it’s just a really good environment and a great group of guys. I’m excited for whenever we get back going.”"

“If cases begin to go up again, particularly if they go up dramatically, it’s important to recognize that more mitigation efforts such as what were implemented back in March may be needed again,” Jay Butler, the agency’s deputy director for infectious diseases, told reporters Friday.
However, the second wave of lockdowns could be accomplished on a local, rather than state-wide level, Butler said.
“Right now, communities are experiencing different levels of transmission occurring, as they gradually ease up onto the community mitigation efforts and gradually reopen,” he said.
Fear of an infection resurgence — and new lockdowns — fueled a stock slump on Thursday after U.S. coronavirus cases rose last week after five weeks of declines."

Meanwhile, Egypt reported its biggest daily increase on Saturday. Infections were rising in some U.S. states as President Donald Trump pushed for businesses to reopen despite warnings by public health experts.
China had 57 new confirmed cases in the 24 hours through midnight Saturday, the National Health Commission reported. That was the highest since mid-April and included 36 in the capital, Beijing, a city of 20 million people.
Beijing’s cases all were linked to its biggest wholesale food market, which was shut down Saturday, the official China News Service reported, citing the city’s disease control agency. It said 27 worked there and nine had direct or indirect exposure to it.
The Xinfadi market was closed after 50 people tested positive for the virus in the Chinese capital’s first confirmed cases in 50 days.
The world is seeing more than 100,000 newly confirmed cases every day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
China, where the pandemic began in December, and other countries that suffered early on including South Korea, Italy and Spain have seen numbers of new infections decline. Brazil, India, the United States and other countries are seeing large increases.
China responded to the outbreak with the world’s most intensive anti-disease controls, isolating cities with some 60 million people and shutting down much of its economy in steps that later were imitated by some other governments.
The ruling Communist party eased most limits on business and travel after declaring victory over the disease in March. Some curbs still are in place including a ban on most foreign travelers arriving in the country.
On Saturday, authorities in Beijing locked down 11 residential communities near the Xinfadi market. White fencing sealed off a road leading to apartment buildings and drivers were required to show identification to enter the area.
South Korea’s government reported 34 more coronavirus cases, adding to an upward trend in infections.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 30 of the new cases were in the greater Seoul area, where half of the country’s 51 million people live. New cases have been linked to nightlife establishments, church services, a large-scale e-commerce warehouse and door-to-door sellers.
The Egyptian Health Ministry announced 1,677 new confirmed cases. Egypt is the Arab world’s most populous country and has its highest coronavirus death toll. The country has reported 1,484 deaths and 42,980 confirmed cases.
In the United States, the number of new cases in the southwestern state of Arizona has risen to more than 1,000 per day from fewer than 400 when the state’s shutdown was lifted in mid-May, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.
Gov. Doug Ducey is not requiring Arizona residents to wear masks in public despite warnings by public health experts outside the government.
Elsewhere, bar owners in New Orleans were preparing to reopen. San Francisco restaurants resumed outdoor seating Friday and the California government allowed hotels, zoos, museums and aquariums to reopen.
The states of Utah and Oregon suspended further reopening of their economies due to a spike in cases.
The latest Chinese cases raised the mainland’s total to 83.132, with 4,634 deaths, according to the Health Commission. South Korea has reported 12,085 cases and 277 deaths.
Also Sunday, China’s air regulator announced China Southern Airlines was required to suspend flights between Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the southern city of Guangzhou for four weeks after 17 passengers on Thursday’s flight tested positive for the virus.
Beijing allows each airline to make one flight per week on each route. Under rules announced on June 4, a route will be suspended for one week if five passengers on a flight test positive and four weeks if the number rises to 10.
In Europe, France’s highest administrative court ruled Saturday that virus concerns no longer justify banning public protests.
The Council of State’s decision allows for demonstrations and marches as long as health protections are respected. Events must be declared in advance to local authorities and not deemed a risk to public order.
The ruling came as an unauthorized protest against police violence and racial injustice wound down in Paris. Police had stopped at least 15,000 protesters from a planned march through the city Saturday, citing virus-related restrictions on any gathering of more than 10 people."
393,Trump’s coronavirus testing joke riles up Biden campaign,https://nypost.com/2020/06/21/biden-campaign-calls-trumps-coronavirus-remarks-outrageous/,2020-06-21 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Joe Biden described President Trump’s comments during an Oklahoma rally that the White House should slow down the amount of coronavirus testing to reduce the number of cases as “outrageous” — even as Trump’s campaign explained he was “obviously kidding.”
“Trump just admitted that he’s putting politics ahead of the safety and economic well-being of the American people — even as we just recorded the highest number of new COVID-19 cases in almost two months and 20 million workers remain out of work,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said in a statement issued late Saturday.
She said the president’s remarks would linger “long after tonight’s debacle of a rally.”
“This virus has killed nearly 120,000 Americans and cost tens of millions their jobs, in large part because this president could not and would not mobilize testing as quickly as we needed it. To hear him say tonight that he has ordered testing slowed — a transparent attempt to make the numbers look better — is appalling,” she added.
About an hour before Bedingfield released the statement, Biden tweeted his response.
“Speed up the testing,” the former vice president wrote.
Speaking at a rally in Tulsa — his first since March — Trump said coronavirus testing is a “double-edged sword” because it increases the total number of cases.
“We have tested now 25 million people. It is probably 20 million people more than anybody else,” he told the crowd. “Here’s the bad part. When you test to that extent, you are going to find more people, find more cases. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down please.’ They test and they test.”
A White House official later said Trump was “obviously kidding,” according the Washington Post.
Trump made the remark at the 19,000-set BOK Center in Tulsa during a reboot of his re-election campaign.
But the rally didn’t attract the crowds the campaign had anticipated and much of the arena’s upper tier remained empty.
The Trump campaign also canceled an appearance at an outdoor stage when crowds failed to show up.
Campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh blamed the modest crowd on the ongoing nationwide protests and the media.
“Sadly, protesters interfered with supporters, even blocking access to metal detectors, which prevented people from entering the rally,” he said.
“Radical protesters coupled with relentless onslaught from the media, attempted to frighten off the President’s supporters,” he added. “We are proud of the thousands who stuck it out.”"
394,How to negotiate a raise at work amid the coronavirus pandemic,https://nypost.com/2020/06/21/how-to-negotiate-a-raise-at-work-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic/,2020-06-21 00:00:00,"Right now, you probably feel pretty lucky just to have a job. And, amid the economic uncertainties and salary cuts, you’re also likely thinking that now is a good time to bite your lip when it comes to talking money with your boss.
Wrong. Whether you’re long overdue for a raise, or if one was tabled post-coronavirus outbreak, or if you are struggling financially and could use a salary boost perhaps because of a salary cut, speaking up right now — if approached strategically — is a great way to show how indispensable you are and get more money or other perks.
Know your worth
Ineke McMahon, director at Path to Promotion, has seen some of her career-development course clients express hesitations about asking for anything right now because “there are a lot of other people who would take my job for less money.” Forget that myth.
“The loss of human capital and knowledge cannot be fixed by replacing existing staff, possessing existing intellectual capital and relationships internally and externally, with new staff,” says McMahon.
“The costs of hiring, training and integrating new people into the workforce, especially when working from home, is far more complicated than keeping the great staff that are already in place.”
To that end, you may find it beneficial to take inventory of all that you bring to the table right now, so you have the facts handy for a talk with your boss.
Taking on new roles and responsibilities in wake of the COVID-19 crisis? Jot it down. Spearheading your company’s crisis communications? Add it to the list.
“Make sure that you are objectively taking note [of all of these things] and sharing that with your manager,” says Fotini Iconomopoulos, negotiation consultant and author of the upcoming book “Say Less, Get More” (HarperCollins, 2021). “For example, if you’re speaking to more clients per day, churning out more business than usual, picking up the slack for being short-staffed and more, bring that up.”
Iconomopoulos recommends framing the chat around the idea that you’ve been contributing more and would like to make sure you are compensated for stepping up. Be confident and consider things from your employer’s perspective.
They’re benefiting from all that you do, and losing you right now would be a particularly trying blow with many new-hire searches on freeze or considering the bandwidth it would take to train a new employee.
Take on more work 
Asking to take on additional work for an additional salary adjustment is a solid idea. “Develop a business plan to present to management,” says Jill Tipograph, co-founder of Early Stage Careers. “Phrase it as: ‘If I temporarily take over customer service for the next three months, could you increase my pay by 15 percent?’ — or whatever is reasonable,” she says.
To gauge if your ask seems sensible, ask three friends from diverse backgrounds to assess if your request is fair. But be warned that “once your salary request is presented, you cannot take it back,” says Tipograph.
Ask for a one-time bonus
Some companies have initiated salary freezes right now, and a raise may be out of the question. For these cases, “ask your employer if you can receive a performance-based bonus once the company rebounds,” says Lynda Spiegel, job search coach and founder of Rising Star Resume, who concedes that many employers may be reluctant to commit to this right now.
Nevertheless, substantiate your accomplishments as you would pre-pandemic when negotiating for a raise. If you’re successful, a good strategy would be to “graciously accept a commitment to defer the salary increase until the crisis abates,” says Spiegel.
Already owed a raise? Try this
“If you were due for a raise as the virus issue emerged, it would be good to memorialize any/all discussions that occur — save e-mails, send yourself notes of verbal discussions and dates — because when the time comes to get things back on track, the person(s) you had this discussion with may no longer be with the firm,” says Tipograph.
Remember, salary enhancements are earned and not doled out, so continue to put in the grunt work if you expect to be recognized.
“Early careerists especially, should use this time to go above and beyond at work. They have been hit among the hardest as a generation during this time,” says Tipograph.
Ask for the fun stuff
If a raise or bonus won’t get the green light, there’s still plenty of room to obtain work-life improvements from your company right now, whether it’s additional vacation days, a permanent or part-time work-from-home setup or another benefit.
First, get the obvious things approved. If you’re working from home, you could ask your employer to pay for items like Wi-Fi, phone, additional computer monitors, office chairs, microphones, webcams and other essentials.
“You can make the case for the [items] related to your work as they directly relate to productivity and professionalism,” says Benjamin Ritter, leadership and empowerment coach and founder of Live for Yourself Consulting. As Iconomopoulos notes, these expenses typically come out of a different budget than salaries.
You can also ask for extra vacation days for 2021 or to have a portion of this year’s days carried over, assistance with child-care costs and even workout equipment. (Bet you never thought you’d miss the company’s dingy basement gym.) Given the prominence placed on psychological well-being, you may also want to ask for mental-health days if you feel like you could use some extra time off.
“Think of all of the things that would make your life easier. When your life is easier, you’re a more motivated employee for the long term,” says Iconomopoulos. And during this stressful time, when it’s likely your boss doesn’t even know what day of the week it is, the head honchos want that kind of staffer more than ever."
395,Sergio Garcia: Others ‘probably deserved’ coronavirus more than Nick Watney,https://nypost.com/2020/06/21/sergio-garcia-others-probably-deserved-coronavirus-more-than-nick-watney/,2020-06-21 00:00:00,"Sergio Garcia was disheartened by Nick Watney becoming the first PGA Tour player to test positive for coronavirus.
“I felt terrible for Nick because he’s probably one of the nicest guys on Tour,” Garcia said Saturday, according to Golf Digest. “Unfortunately, it had to happen to him. So there’s a lot of other people that probably deserved it a lot more than him, and he’s the one that got it.”
Watney, 39, had to withdraw after the first round of the RBC Heritage in Hilton Head after testing positive. He must self-isolate for 10 days, per the Tour’s safety guidelines.
The 40-year-old Garcia was worried because Watney rode with him on his private jet from Colonial in Fort Worth to the Heritage, and both tested negative for COVID-19 upon arrival. Garcia has since tested negative again.
“I was a little bit afraid because, obviously, we knew—I gave him a ride on Tuesday, but when we landed on Tuesday, we got tested. We were both negative. So it was all good,” Garcia told Golf Digest. “Then I was surprised to hear that he tested positive two days, three days later. Obviously, I got my test done yesterday, and I was negative. But it was about 4 1/2 hours of waiting, very anxiously, hoping that it was negative because, obviously, after missing the cut last week by one and this week finally playing nicely in the second round and being in the middle of the pack, if I would have given positive, then I wouldn’t be able to play on the weekend, and I would have been very, very disappointed.
“Nick is unbelievable. He’s a good friend. He was very worried about me. He sent me several texts. I talked to him. He must have said sorry to me probably 25 times.”"

There is a growing concern among players, executives and the league office, according to ESPN, as coronavirus cases in Florida continue to swell. The state has become a hot spot of late, with 4,049 new cases on Saturday, breaking the old single-day record — which was set on Friday. The positive rate for tests Saturday was 12.4 percent, according to reports, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he has no plans for slowing the reopening of the state.
NBA commissioner Adam Silver recently had a “tense” call with high-level team executives in which he acknowledged the surge of cases in Florida, ESPN reported. His tone was “resolute but somber,” according to the report, as he pledged to move forward with the NBA’s plans.
The league is “closely monitoring the data in Florida and Orange County and will continue to work collaboratively with the National Basketball Players Association, public health officials and medical experts regarding our plans,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass told ESPN.
The NBA is planning to bring 22 teams to Orlando, with games set to begin on July 30 and a potential champion crowned by October. Players, including Nets guard Kyrie Irving, have voiced concerns about having to spend up to four months living in the bubble, which is aimed at keeping everyone inside healthy. The league recently issued a lengthy memo outlining the strict protocols in place.
Starting Tuesday, teams will reportedly be permitted to have up to 10 coaches at their facilities with training camp on the horizon, even as the worrisome numbers continue to surge in Florida.
“Can’t say I am surprised, given the state’s approach to reopening,” NBPA executive director Michele Roberts told ESPN regarding the rising numbers. “We are obviously clearly monitoring the situation. While we take some solace in knowing our players will not travel commercially to get to Orlando, that access to the campus is severely limited and, of course, all of the other health and safety protocols in place, the numbers will keep our attention. If necessary to add further restrictions respecting those third parties (Disney staffers) having access to the campus, we will seek to implement them.”"
397,DeSantis takes dig at Cuomo for considering quarantining Floridians,https://nypost.com/2020/06/21/desantis-takes-dig-at-gov-cuomo-over-quarantine-for-floridians/,2020-06-21 00:00:00,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took a dig at Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s coronavirus response — now that the Empire State is “considering” imposing a quarantine on visitors from the Sunshine State.
“I would just ask if that’s done just please do not quarantine any Floridians in the nursing homes in New York,” DeSantis quipped Saturday at a press conference in Tallahassee when asked about the potential travel restrictions.
Cuomo has faced criticism for virus-related deaths among the elderly population after health officials ordered nursing homes and rehabilitation centers admit to COVID-19 patients being discharged from hospitals.
During the height of the Empire State’s crisis, DeSantis said that New Yorkers fleeing to Florida were required to self-quarantine for two weeks when they arrived.
But with the Sunshine State’s case tally growing, the tables have now turned for the states.
On Thursday, Cuomo said a quarantine on travelers from Florida to New York was “something I’m considering”
“I have experts who have advised me to do that. I’m considering it now,” Cuomo said at a press conference.
Florida has recorded more than 93,000 COVID-19 total infections, while New York has seen at least 387,000, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University."

“That was tongue in cheek,” trade adviser Peter Navarro said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “Come on now. That was tongue in cheek, please.”
CNN host Jake Tapper pushed back, saying testing is a “very serious issue.”
“It was a light moment, OK?” Navarro responded.
Pressed further, Navarro said, “all right, we’re 60 seconds into a tongue in cheek thing, asked and answered.”
“I think what’s important going on in this world today are things like John Bolton leaking, publishing a book. Here’s the breaking news for you,” he continued.
The president, speaking at his first campaign rally since March on Saturday, told the crowd in Tulsa that coronavirus testing is a “double-edged sword.”
“We have tested now 25 million people. It is probably 20 million people more than anybody else,” he said. “Here’s the bad part. When you test to that extent, you are going to find more people, find more cases. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down please.’ They test and they test.”
Acting Department of Homeland Security Director Chad Wolf on Sunday said Trump’s remarks were brought on by frustration that the media fails to cover his accomplishments.
“I think that what you heard from the president was frustration, frustration in the sense of that we are testing, I believe we’ve tested over 25 million Americans. We’ve tested more than any other country in this world,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
“Instead, the press and others, all they want to focus on is an increasing case count. And we know that that’s going to occur when you test individuals more and more and more.”"
399,Coronavirus closures help DEA seize millions of dollars from drug traffickers,https://nypost.com/2020/06/21/coronavirus-closures-help-dea-seize-millions-from-drug-traffickers/,2020-06-21 00:00:00,"Coronavirus business closures have left drug traffickers high and dry when it comes to laundering their ill-gotten gains — and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has been using the opportunity to clean up, The Post has learned.
In April and May of this year, investigators from the New York DEA office seized $16 million in cash from a sophisticated money-laundering operation involving Chinese gangsters, Mexican drug cartels and local Dominican pushers — compared to just $5 million in the same period last year.
Similarly, in the first two weeks of June, agents confiscated $3.1 million, compared to $1.2 million in 2019.
“Our office is busier than ever, drug trafficking is continuing in the New York metropolitan area. The demand for drugs has remained high during this pandemic,” Ray Donovan, the special agent in charge of the New York DEA, told The Post.
“While the country’s primary focus should be the pandemic, the shadow of the pandemic is the drug business,” he added.
The coronavirus led to an uptick in cash confiscations because it derailed a complex drug-trafficking scheme between the Mexican Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, Dominican drug dealers and various factions of the Chinese Triads organized-crime syndicate.
Before the pandemic hit, the cartels distributed fentanyl-laced heroin to the street-level Dominican dealers, who in turn kicked up cash profits to the Chinese gangsters.
The Chinese criminals would then use the money to buy goods in the US — cellphones, computers, cars — and flip them in China for a profit before paying back the cartel traffickers.
A phone bought in the US for $500 could sell in China for as much as $2,000, Special Agent Donovan said.
When stores in New York shut as the city went on lockdown, the gangsters couldn’t go shopping for the goods, leaving them with an excess amount of cash — and opportunity for the feds to seize it.
The shopping scheme doesn’t work with online purchases because authorities can more easily trace who is buying the goods.
“The store closings have stalled their distribution methodology. They can’t spend the cash and that is why we are confiscating record amounts,” Donovan added.
In addition, the limited number of flights in and out of the US — plus stricter border and highway enforcement — has blocked the same flow of drugs from entering the country and the cash from leaving.
The effort to block drug-trafficking is critical right now because overdose deaths have increased every year since 2015, according to Donovan.
“The DEA has to use all of its resources to stop the drug business as best as it can before it continues to harm and kill more American citizens,” he said."

An Italian infectious disease doctor believes the coronavirus has become less dangerous — and could disappear on its own without a vaccine.
Dr. Matteo Bassetti, the head of the infectious diseases clinic at the San Martino hospital, said the virus appears to have become less potent, possibly due to genetic mutations, the Sunday Telegraph reported.
“The clinical impression I have is that the virus is changing in severity,” Bassetti told the outlet.
“In March and early April the patterns were completely different. People were coming to the emergency department with a very difficult to manage illness and they needed oxygen and ventilation, some developed pneumonia.”
But he said in the past month, “the picture has completely changed in terms of patterns.”
“It was like an aggressive tiger in March and April but now it’s like a wild cat,” Bassetti said. “Even elderly patients, aged 80 or 90, are now sitting up in bed and they are breathing without help. The same patients would have died in two or three days before.”
He said one of the reasons for the virus becoming weaker could be that it has mutated in response to social distancing measures.
“I think the virus has mutated because our immune system reacts to the virus and we have a lower viral load now due to the lockdown, mask-wearing, social distancing,” he said. “We still have to demonstrate why it’s different now.”
It’s possible that the virus will be eradicated before researchers find a vaccine, he said.
“We have fewer and fewer people infected and it could end up with the virus dying out,” Bassetti said.
But another expert was less optimistic about the prospect of the virus disappearing soon, saying it could take years, the outlet reported.
“I don’t expect it to die out that quickly,” said Dr. Bharat Pankhania, a professor at the UK’s University of Exeter Medical School, according to the report.
“It will if it has no one to infect. If we have a successful vaccine, then we’ll be able to do what we did with smallpox. But because it’s so infectious and widespread, it won’t go away for a very long time.”"

Fewer than one percent of the 67,526 tests administered in the Empire State came back positive for COVID-19 Saturday — part of a trend showing infection numbers shrinking over the past several days, according to state health data.
In total, 664 people statewide tested positive Saturday, down from 716 Friday and 796 Thursday. Of that number, a total of 385 cases were reported in New York City Saturday, fewer than the 391 on Friday.
“Yesterday, less than 1 percent of COVID-19 tests conducted in the state were positive, which means we continue to be on the right path toward defeating the virus,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Sunday.
”The COVID-19 pandemic isn’t over, and as we reopen New York safely and incrementally, the state government will continue to provide timely information so that New Yorkers can make educated decisions for themselves and their families.”
Fatality numbers are also decreasing across New York, with 15 deaths statewide reported Saturday, down from 24 on Friday and 25 on Thursday, according to the data.
The potentially promising report comes as the Big Apple gears up to begin Phase Two of its reopening plan Monday, which will allow outdoor dining and hair salons and barbershops to open.
While the number of infections shrank in New York City, the percentage of new reported cases actually increased slightly from 1.1 to 1.2 percent from Friday to Saturday, because fewer people were tested Friday.
Meanwhile, the number of cases in some Western and Southern states, including California and Florida, have spiked dramatically in recent days."

Goran Ivanisevic, one of Djokovic’s coaches, said the news from Dimitrov was “shocking” and that “now everyone will have to be tested.”
Dimitrov, ranked No. 19 and a three-time Grand Slam semifinalist, is the highest-profile current player to say he has the virus. His announcement Sunday on his Instagram page comes at the end of a week when the U.S. Open said it would go forward.
The professional tennis tours have been suspended since March and are planning to resume in August.
Dimitrov said he was making his condition public because he wanted to “make sure anyone who has been in contact with me during these past days gets tested.”
“I am so sorry for any harm I might have caused,” he wrote.
The Bulgarian featured last week in the Serbia leg of the Adria Tour exhibition event organized by Djokovic. There was criticism that there was no social distancing at the exhibition, which took place before packed stands in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. The Serbian government lifted most virus restrictions last month despite dozens of new cases being registered.
Dimitrov also played a match against Borna Coric in Croatia, at the Adriatic resort of Zadar, on Saturday in the second leg of the exhibition series. After the match, he complained about fatigue. He said in his post that he was tested in Monaco.
Organizers said Sunday the exhibition has now been canceled. Djokovic had been scheduled to play Russia’s Andrey Rublev in the final.
Besides Djokovic, other leading players participated in the events, including Dominic Thiem in Belgrade and Alexander Zverev in both tournaments.
Djokovic has initially struck a skeptical tone if he would play at the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadows from Aug. 31 to Sept. 13.
Some of the sport’s top names, including defending men’s champion Rafael Nadal along with top-ranked Ash Barty have expressed reservations about heading somewhere that was a hot spot for the COVID-19 outbreak. Others expressed an eagerness to return to action.
The U.S. Open normally is the fourth and final Grand Slam tournament of each season but would be the second major of 2020, following the Australian Open, which concluded in early February."

Andrew Cuomo took aim at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ coronavirus response Sunday — after his Sunshine State counterpart made a dig about the Empire State.
The war of words began Saturday when DeSantis was asked about Cuomo saying he was considering imposing a quarantine for Floridian visitors.
“I would just ask if that’s done just please do not quarantine any Floridians in the nursing homes in New York,” DeSantis quipped at a press conference.
Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo senior advisor, fired back at DeSantis on Sunday, retorting, “said the guy who can’t even put on a mask on the right way!”
“Maybe less time repeating right-wing Twitter bots and more time‎ trying to competently manage the pandemic that’s spiking in his state,” Azzopardi said. “His citizens, which polls show have zero faith in him, might appreciate it.”
DeSantis was seen in a viral video failing to secure one of the loops of his N95 mask around his head, leaving the band hanging — and rendering the protective gear useless.
Meanwhile, Florida has seen a rate of infections remaining high, with nearly 12 percent of recent tests coming back from labs as positive.
With nearly 3,500 new infections on Sunday, the state’s total rose to more than 97,000, officials said.
The death toll also jumped to at least 3,160, including 17 additional deaths announced Sunday.

Several thousand protesters had gathered in the Malieveld area in The Hague, close to the Dutch seat of government, even though the rally had been banned by the municipality.
“We have detained some 400 people today. A large number of them have been since let go,” the police said on Twitter.
The authorities had allowed a brief protest to go ahead in the afternoon before asking demonstrators to leave.
Protesters were wearing T-shirts that read: “Stop the lockdown” and carried banners demanding that the Dutch rule to keep a distance of 1.5 metres (5 feet) from one another be lifted.
Police eventually ended the demonstration and detained a group of 400 people who refused to leave.
The Hague Mayor Johan Remkes said the demonstration was banned because authorities had information that “troublemakers” from all over the Netherlands, including groups of known football hooligans, were planning to descend on The Hague.
“This has nothing to do with protesting or the right to freedom of speech. This group was deliberately trying to disturb public order,” Remkes said in a statement."

Brazil now has a total of 1,085,038 confirmed cases and 50,617 deaths, up from 49,976 on Saturday, the Health Ministry said. Experts say the true numbers are a lot higher because of a lack of widespread testing. Latin America’s largest country has typically recorded more than 1,000 deaths a day, but usually registers fewer on the weekends.
Brazil confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on Feb. 26 and passed 1 million cases on Friday. Since first arriving in the country, the virus’ rapid spread has eroded support for right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro and has raised fears of economic collapse after years of anemic growth.
Bolsonaro, sometimes called the “Tropical Trump,” has been widely criticized for his handling of the crisis. The country still has no permanent health minister after losing two since April, following clashes with the president.
Bolsonaro has shunned social distancing, calling it a job-killing measure more dangerous than the virus itself. He has also promoted two anti-malarial drugs as remedies, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, despite little evidence they work.
On Sunday, Bolsonaro said the military serves the will of the people and its mission is to defend democracy, adding fuel to a raging debate about the armed forces’ role amid rumbling fears of political fragility.
His comments came on the same day his supporters and detractors gathered in cities across the country, in a stark symbol of the polarization in Latin America’s largest country."

Scores of black-owned businesses making the rounds on social media are helping some Big Apple eateries bounce back from the coronavirus sooner than expected.
LoLo’s Seafood Shack in Harlem, known for its Caribbean-style seafood, has seen revenues go from 50 percent during the darkest days of the pandemic to 70 percent — and now back up to 100 percent as efforts to support black-owned businesses gain steam, said owner Leticia “Skai” Young-Mohan.
Business has become so brisk in recent weeks that Young-Mohan — who runs LoLo’s with chef-husband Raymond Mohan — has added a takeout/pickup window to more safely serve customers. The eatery, which serves Belizean conch fritters for $9.87 and softshell crab sandwiches for $12, had previously been letting patrons in the store two at a time.
“It started to get busier and we wanted everyone to be safe,” said Young-Mohan, who was born and raised in Harlem. “It was a safer way for everyone to interact — from our team to the community.”
While there’s no telling how long the boom will last, Young-Mohan says she sees signs that it’s more than a temporary bump, including a recent surge in customers on Juneteenth, a holiday to honor the end of slavery. June 19 “was literally the busiest day — not including catering — that LoLo’s Seafood Shack has ever had in the five-year history of the company,” Young-Mohan said. “Makes me all the more optimistic that support of black-owned businesses is here to stay.”
Journalist-activist Dorissa White agrees. “People are rethinking how they consume and it is for the better,” said White, who recently launched a Buy Black challenge for New Yorkers to restrict themselves to patronizing black-owned enterprises for 30 days.
“Businesses, especially in New York, have reached out to say they’ve seen an increase in Web and food traffic and in some cases they have even sold out of their products,” White said, noting that Melba Wilson of Harlem’s legendary restaurant, Melba’s, sold out her entire inventory of cookbooks.
In lower Manhattan, Robert “Don Pooh” Cummins, a music executive and restaurateur who co-owns Brooklyn Chop House, says his eatery — known for selling dumplings and sushi alongside steak — has seen an average of 100 more deliveries a day since the racial justice protests began.
The restaurant, located across the street from City Hall, has been giving back to protesters, including a recent delivery of hundreds of dumplings and chicken satays to gathering activists. “I think this unfortunate tragedy is uniting everyone,” he said of the George Floyd killing.
Aliyyah Baylor, owner of Make My Cake on the Upper West Side and Ma Smith’s Dessert Cafe in Harlem, said she was barely making payroll after the pandemic hit, with sales down to just $500 a day at its worst.
But then, thanks to the swell of support for black-owned businesses as a way to alleviate systemic racism, “I’m now up to 75 percent of what I was generating pre-pandemic,” she said.
“People say they have seen us on support-black-business lists. There are a lot of lists circulating, and we’re on apps and on Facebook posts. There have been a lot of new customers,” she said.
Delicious food at the right price remains a top priority for most customers, she added, but many mom-and-pop outlets get overlooked simply because they aren’t well-known brands — not because they don’t provide excellent quality and service, she said.
Baylor estimates that some 50 percent of her client base are new customers drawn to the lists making the rounds on social media. And she’s already seeing many of them return because they enjoyed their experience and want to make a difference.
“I strongly feel that this is not a trend. It’s not a flash in the pan,” Baylor said. “People are adding the black-owned businesses to their community-shopping networks and building relationships.”"
407,Amsterdam’s red light district set to lift coronavirus shutdown this week,https://nypost.com/2020/06/28/amsterdams-red-light-district-can-lift-coronavirus-shutdown-wednesday/,2020-06-28 00:00:00,"Amsterdam’s red light district just got the green light to emerge from its coronavirus shutdown.
Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said sex workers could get back to the grind beginning Wednesday, as daily reported COVID-19 deaths in The Netherlands fell to the single digits, the UK’s Sunday Telegraph reported.
“It’s a contact job like the hairdresser and masseur, and so they need to ask in advance if [clients] have any symptoms,” Rutte cautioned.
The prime minister said he’d requested information “about which positions were possible and which weren’t” from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment — “but there was no further explanation.”
Still, at least one union has advised sex workers to stick to a strict safety protocol, including wearing latex gloves and face masks to protect themselves and their clients.
Red Light Union also suggested avoiding kissing, oral sex and only offering positions where they don’t have to face another person, according to the Daily Mail.
Many of the country’s sex workers have been left financially strapped by the lockdown, which began on March 16 and shuttered all schools, bars, restaurants, gyms and contact professions like theirs.
Activist and webcam and porn performer Yvette Luhrs told a local radio station that the upcoming reopening was bittersweet.
“It took too long for a colleague who ended it all earlier this week,” she told NOS Radio 1. “But also for people who have been evicted from their homes, and for the sex workers who just had to carry on working and were at risk.”"

A California man says he and 27 members of his family tested positive for the coronavirus, including his dad, who succumbed to the illness just before Father’s Day.
Richard Garay told Los Angeles-based TV station KTLA that he was the first in his family to come down with COVID-19 symptoms last month.
“It went from running nose to headache to full-blown fever,” Garay said.
Soon after, his 60-year-old father, Vidal Garay, also caught the illness — and his condition quickly worsened.
“It was painful to watch my dad’s health decline so drastically in front of me,” Garay told the outlet.
His last words to his father were: “Dad, I don’t think I’m going to make it.”
But while Garay eventually recovered, his dad didn’t, passing away on June 20, a day before Father’s Day.
It’s unclear how so many people in the family became infected, but Garay thinks it could have been from a relative who visited in mid-May or from his mother’s caretaker, according to CBSLA.
Most of Garay’s relatives who got sick, including his own children and his brother’s pregnant wife, have also recovered.
But Garay said he is sharing his family’s story as a cautionary tale for people to take measures to protect themselves and their loved ones against the virus.
“I don’t want my father’s death to be in vain,” he said. “I want people to understand coronavirus is a real thing.”"
409,NYC first responders sue ambulance operator for pay and work violations,https://nypost.com/2020/06/28/nyc-first-responders-sue-ambulance-operator-for-pay-work-violations/,2020-06-28 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Out-of-state EMTs and paramedics who risked their lives to help New Yorkers during the coronavirus crisis say the FEMA subcontractor that hired them controlled every second of their deployment, including their sex lives — and then refused to pay them for all of their time.
According to a stunning lawsuit filed in Brooklyn state court, private ambulance operator Ambulnz promised the group of first responders it recruited back in March it “would be paid for 24-hours a day, 7-days a week” for deploying to the city as the COVID-19 cases began skyrocketing.
But Ambulnz went back on its word after the recruits arrived, including by refusing to pay people for the time it took to drive their ambulances to NYC, according to the suit.
Once in the Big Apple, Ambulnz told the recruits “to remain in their hotel rooms at all times when not on shift,” the lawsuit said, and were ordered to refrain from “consuming alcohol or engaging in any sexual activity while at their hotel, in order to remain ‘on call’ for any emergencies.”
Those who disobeyed faced punishment, including possible termination, according to the suit. Ambulnz even placed a security guard in the hotel lobby and required its workers to carry GPS devices to ensure they stayed put, the lawsuit said.
In an interview with The Post, lead plaintiff James Richard said he worked seven days a week for the month of April, responding to heart attacks, gunshot incidents and COVID-19 cases while helping the fire department respond to 911 calls. When he wasn’t working, Richard said he was awakened by blaring calls on his emergency-responder radio, which he was required to have with him at all times.
The 29-year-old EMT from Murfreesboro, Tenn., said he only learned of the company’s actual pay policy about two weeks into his stint when he was given a document showing that his pay — 1.25 times his regular pay, plus overtime, for seven 12-hour shifts a week — would be less than other FEMA responders.
Richard was told he could accept the terms or go home, he said. “I didn’t want to leave New York in that state,” Richard said about the city’s massive COVID-19 caseload. “Morally, I couldn’t do that.”
FEMA declined to provide information about its pay requirements, but the lawsuit claims that all other ambulance services companies contracted by FEMA during this time paid their EMTs and paramedics for 24/7 shifts.
Once its workers returned home, Ambulnz asked them to sign general-release agreements giving up their right to recover unpaid wages, said Sally Abrahamson, the group’s lawyer. She said the company also is trying to enforce arbitration agreements it had EMTs sign shortly before deploying them.
Ambulnz defended its pay practices in a statement saying that it “verified compensation practices for our New York City COVID-19 response contract with two separate, independent top-tier labor law firms,” and that both firms “confirmed that our payroll practices exceeded the amount required by law.“
However, legal experts indicated such employment conditions merit better treatment. “When you tell an employee you have to stay in your hotel room, can’t have a beer, and can’t have sex, that’s pretty good evidence that the time belongs to the company and should be compensable,” said labor lawyer Louis Pechman, who teaches a course on wage theft at Fordham Law School."
410,Rudy Gobert still has smelling issue months after coronavirus diagnosis,https://nypost.com/2020/06/28/jazzs-rudy-gobert-not-fully-over-coronavirus-effects-plans-to-play/,2020-06-28 00:00:00,"The NBA shut down in March when Rudy Gobert became its first player to test positive for coronavirus.
More than three months later, with the league now preparing for a return, the Jazz center is still experiencing its effects.
“The taste has returned, but the smell is still not 100 percent,” Gobert recently told L’Equipe in his native France, as translated by HoopsHype. “I can smell the smells, but not from afar. I spoke to specialists, who told me that it could take up to a year.”
A loss of taste and smell is one of the virus’ symptoms. The 28-year-old Gobert is still expected to play when the NBA resumes its season in Orlando on July 30.
The NBA tested 302 players last Tuesday and 16 tested positive, the league said Friday.
The Jazz announced on March 27 that Gobert and teammate Donovan Mitchell had both been cleared of the virus. Gobert was the NBA’s patient zero, with his positive test coming back the night of March 11, immediately leading the NBA to suspend its season.
The virus wasn’t Gobert’s only problem, though. He was also reportedly “careless” in the Jazz’s locker room leading up to his diagnosis. It caused a reported rift with Mitchell, who later tested positive, and The Athletic reported that their relationship “doesn’t appear salvageable.” But with the resumption of the season now on the horizon, the two have worked to mend the relationship.
“I think right now, we’re in good shape,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder recently said on ESPN’s “First Take.” “Those guys are getting ready to play, they’re as excited as anybody on our team or anybody in the league.”"

Greg Abbott, who warned that the coronavirus had taken a “very swift and very dangerous turn” in the state.
Pence was wearing a mask when he arrived at the “Celebrate Freedom Rally” at the First Baptist Church, which can hold around 3,000 people, CNN said.
There were roughly 2,200 people in attendance at the mask-optional event, the outlet said. At least 50 percent of the crowd was in masks, according to a pool report.
“Working with your governor, we will put the health of the people of the Lone Star state first, and every single day, we will continue to reclaim our freedom and our way of life, as each day we are one day closer to the day we put this pandemic past, and when we do, with this governor and this president, we will bring Texas and America bigger and better than ever before,” Pence said, according to CNN.
Pence later met with Abbott, a Republican, as he urged everyone to wear a face mask.
“President Trump wanted us to be here today with the developments over the last two weeks with the rising positivity and the rising number of cases with a very simple message, and that is to [tell the] people of Texas: ‘We’re with you,’ ” Pence said, the Dallas Morning News reported.

The state has recorded at least 73,908 cases, with infections rising at a faster rate than testing has increased in recent weeks, according to the outlet.
The grim record comes as large crowds flocked to the Salt River east of Phoenix over the weekend to beat the heat.
Dozens of people, many of whom were seen without face masks, were photographed packed together tubing along the river.
Gov. Doug Ducey has called on Arizonans to take more steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including staying home except when necessary and wearing face masks in public, KTAR reported.
“The rate of the spread of this virus is unacceptable and it is time for us to step up our actions and our personal responsibilities regarding this virus,” Ducey said Thursday."

FRANKFURT – Workers at six Amazon sites in Germany will go on strike on Monday in protest over safety after some staff at logistics centers tested positive for coronavirus, labour union Verdi said.
Verdi said on Sunday that the strike would last at least 48 hours, under the motto ‘Good and healthy work’, to denounce what it called a lack of transparency by the US retail giant after workers tested positive for COVID-19.
“We have information that at least 30 to 40 colleagues were infected,” said Verdi representative Orhan Akman.
Amazon has faced a long-running battle with unions in Germany over better pay and conditions for logistics workers, who have staged frequent strikes since 2013.
Verdi said the strikes will hit Amazon sites in Leipzig, Bad Hersfeld, Rheinberg, Werne and Koblenz. It said Amazon was putting profit ahead of the safety of its workers.
Amazon rejected the accusations in a statement and said that as of June it had invested $4 billion on measures to protect its global workforce and clients from the risk of COVID-19 infections.
In Germany, its biggest market after the United States, Amazon has since February ordered 470 million hand disinfection bottles, 21 million pairs of gloves, 19 million masks and other face protection gear and 39 million boxes of disinfectant wipes, a spokesman for Amazon in Germany said."

At least 85 people in Michigan have tested positive for the coronavirus after an outbreak at a popular college bar, health officials said.
The cases are all linked to Harper’s Restaurant and Brew Pub, near Michigan State University’s campus in Lansing, the Ingham County Health Department said Saturday.
Eighty of the infections were people who went to the watering hole, while the others were people exposed to customers from the bar, the Lansing State Journal reported.
Of those infected, 23 are asymptomatic, according to the report.
Anyone who went to the bar between June 12 and June 22 has been asked to self-quarantine for 14 days from the date of their visit.
The bar had welcomed packed crowds upon reopening earlier this month — with photos showing shoulder-to-shoulder lines out the door, according to the Detroit Free Press.
Harper’s acknowledged on its Facebook page that it had been unable to enforce social distancing outside of the bar.
“We have attempted to instruct customers waiting in line to wear face coverings and practice social distancing through signage on the public sidewalk and with a banner on our railing,” the bar wrote on Facebook.
“Our oversight of the line on our stairs has been successful, but trying to get customers to follow our recommendations on the public sidewalk has been challenging.”
The bar said it has since closed in order to “devise a strategy that eliminates the lines altogether” — as well as install air purifying technology inside.
“When we have finished implementing these two strategies, we will have the most state-of-the-art neighborhood venue for you to visit safely,” the bar said."

The crowd protested under Black Lives Matter and other banners while waving rainbow flags.
Participants in the march — which was organized by the Reclaim Pride Coalition and called the Queer Liberation March — gathered in Foley Square and began walking to Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village in the early afternoon.
Hosts of the live-streamed event appeared from inside the Stonewall Inn in the Village, where the historic gay-rights riots started 51 years ago to the day.
Event organizers boasted on Twitter that they didn’t have a permit for the march.
The protest occurred at the same time as organizers of the regular Pride march streamed an online production of their event celebrating the city’s LGBTQ community. Sunday was the city parade’s 50th anniversary.
Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, appeared on Fifth Avenue as a series of decorated cars with balloons began slowly making their way downtown as part of the event, which was broadcast on various online platforms.
McCray, who identified as a lesbian before marrying the mayor, was wearing a rainbow feathered boa.
The online event included hosts such as Carson Kressley and Sam Champion and  performances by everyone from Janelle Monae to Billy Porter.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo appeared on video, saying, “New York state will always lead this march for progress.”"

California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday ordered bars in Los Angeles immediately closed — a little more than a week after they were allowed to reopen — amid a surge in local coronavirus cases.
Los Angeles was one of seven counties to have its establishments shut down by state health officials — who urged another eight counties to also follow suit.
“COVID-19 is still circulating in California, and in some parts of the state, growing stronger,” Newsom said in a statement, according to the LA Times.
“That’s why it is critical we take this step to limit the spread of the virus in the counties that are seeing the biggest increases.”
In LA’s case, the move reverses the county’s reopening of its local bars, nail salons and other businesses June 19.
The county reported 2,169 new virus cases Saturday, the Times said. A total of 95,385 cases have been reported in LA so far, with 3,285 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.
Also affected by California’s shutdown order were the counties of Fresno, Imperial, Kings, Kern, San Joaquin and Tulare.
The eight other counties where local health officials were urged by the state to shut down their bars, too, were Contra Costa, Riverside, Sacramento, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, Santa Clara, Stanislaus and Ventura.
“We are actively monitoring COVID-19 across the state and working closely with counties where there are increased rates and concerning patterns of transmission,” said Newsom’s public-health director, Sonia Angell, in a statement.
“Closing bars in these counties is one of a number of targeted actions counties are implementing across our state to slow the virus’ spread and reduce risk.”"

New York City hospitals are rescheduling thousands of elective surgeries that were postponed because of the coronavirus — much to the relief of patients.
“A week before the procedure, I was notified that I had to reschedule. When they canceled it, I said to myself, `Oh, no,’ ” recalled Brooklyn Heights resident Roger Best, 54, who was supposed to go under the knife for his right hip April 21 at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo had issued an emergency edict the previous month that postponed such elective surgeries in a bid to curb the coronavirus. Cuomo lifted the ban June 8 as the pandemic abated.
Best, a tech-systems engineer for HSBC bank who had his left hip replaced in December, ended up finally getting his surgery June 16 — but not before weeks of pain.
“I’m glad I got it done now. You don’t know what the future holds,” Best told The Post.
“I wanted to get it over as quickly as possible. If a second wave of the coronavirus comes, then what happens? If you need one of these procedures, get it done as quickly as possible.”
His doctor, William Macaulay, chief of the Division of Adult Reconstructive Surgery at NYU Langone Health, said NYU Langone had to cancel or postpone more than 3,000 surgeries during the peak of the pandemic, including 700 procedures involving joint replacements.
“We postponed all elective total joint replacements for approximately two months. That corresponded to approximately 700 surgeries postponed,’’ Macaulay told The Post. “We are in the process of catching up on all those postponements.’’
Macaulay said he and many other NYU Langone surgeons had been reassigned to treat COVID-19 patients during the surge.
Rose Saad, 75, of Brooklyn said she was finally able to get delayed colon-cancer surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital when the surgery restriction was lifted. Her surgery had originally been planned for March at another hospital.
“I feel good, thank God. I don’t need any chemotherapy. I’m happy we’re finished with this,” she said.
Lenox Hill is part of Northwell Health, the state’s largest health-care provider overseeing 19 regional hospitals.
Northwell facilities postponed 19,000 urgent-care and elective surgeries during the pandemic.
“We have prioritized those that are more urgent while also trying to schedule elective procedures,” Northwell spokesman Terry Lynam told The Post. “It will probably take until mid-summer before we get to all of them.’’
Meanwhile, the Mount Sinai Hospital’s Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery has resumed gender-assignment surgeries suspended during the COVID-19 surge.
The center performs about 600 transgender surgeries per year, or roughly 10 to 12 per week.
“We’ve been back to normal for a few weeks,’’ said Dr Joshua Safer, executive director of Mt. Sinai’s Transgender program, to The Post.
“This is an enormous relief to our patients.”"
419,Schumer urges Trump admin to renew coronavirus emergency declaration,https://nypost.com/2020/06/28/schumer-urges-trump-to-renew-coronavirus-emergency-declaration/,2020-06-28 00:00:00,"Sen. Chuck Schumer on Sunday urged the Trump administration to renew the coronavirus emergency declaration before it expires at the end of next month, in order to preserve billions of dollars in healthcare funds for New York to fight the pandemic.
“If we have learned anything from COVID-19 it is that a ‘stitch in time saves nine,’ and the more we can do to be proactive, the better off the public will be,” the New York Democrat said.
“This past winter there was delay and dismissal towards those urging HHS to officially declare a public health emergency as it relates to the coronavirus. Well, we cannot — and we must not –have that kind of inaction and uncertainty now, especially with what we know and with the sustaining needs of New York,” Schumer said, referring to Health and Human Services.
“The clock is ticking as July dawns, so we need this action now,” he added.
The Senate minority leader said $300 million in federal healthcare funds were distributed to the Empire State last week, part of the $2.5 billion in the Families First Coronavirus stimulus package that is linked to the emergency declaration that expires on July 25.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which obligated $1.1 billion to the state, is also looking at the emergency declaration to decide how much longer it will need to reimburse New York State and New York City for related expenses.
Without the public health emergency declaration, dollars from the disaster relief fund would stop flowing, Schumer said.
“New York is by no means out of the woods with the coronavirus, especially given the upticks we are seeing in other states and the risk those upticks pose here when you take travel into account,” Schumer said. “Extending this declaration will keep New York positioned to both respond and to keep fighting.”"

Asked about a spike in coronavirus cases across the south — and after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pleaded with residents to wear masks amid a surge in cases there — Pence said each state is in a “unique situation.”
“One of the elements of the genius of America is the principle of federalism, of state and local control. We’ve made it clear that we want to defer to governors. We want to defer to local officials,” Pence said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.
But host John Dickerson said the coronavirus, which has killed more than 127,000 Americans, “doesn’t know federalism,” and questioned why there wasn’t a coordinated national response.
“If we’d have taken that approach, we’d have never had the success that we had in the greater New York City area. We’d have never had the success in Michigan or New Orleans, because from early on, we worked closely in partnership with governors to make sure that they had what they needed when they needed it, tailored to the unique circumstances in their states,” Pence said.
Meanwhile, Pelosi, in an interview on ABC News’ “This Week,” noted that the US has 4 percent of the world’s population but represents 25 percent of the cases worldwide.
“This is life and death. … We don’t have a vaccine, and we don’t have a cure. God willing and science-enabling, we will sometime soon,” she said, adding there are tools to combat the spread.
Asked if mask-wearing should be mandated across the country, the California Democrat said, “Oh, definitely long overdue for that.”
“And my understanding, that the Centers for Disease Control has recommended the use of masks, but not to demand because they don’t want to offend the president,” Pelosi said.
“And the president should be an example. You know, real men wear masks. Be an example to the country and wear the mask. It’s not about protecting yourself. It’s about protecting others and their families.”
Florida has more than 141,000 COVID-19 cases and has been recording record high numbers over the past several days — including 9,585 on Saturday and 8,530 on Sunday.
Texas reported a daily record high 5,996 number of cases on Thursday, with 5,707 on Friday ad 5,747 on Saturday."
421,Gov. Cuomo complains of ‘political heat’ over coronavirus nursing home deaths,https://nypost.com/2020/06/28/gov-cuomo-complains-of-political-heat-over-nursing-home-deaths/,2020-06-28 00:00:00,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday complained about the “political heat” he has faced over coronavirus deaths in nursing homes — claiming the facilities are now safer for seniors than staying at home.
“In New York, we’re number 46 in the nation in terms of percentage of deaths at nursing homes, compared to the total percentage,” Cuomo told Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“If they want to point fingers, not at New York,” he insisted. “I’ve taken political heat, okay? There are facts and there’s politics.”
“We’re number 46, you have 45 other states to point fingers at first,” he said, referring to data recently compiled by the New York Times.
New York has recorded 6,250 COVID-19-related nursing-home deaths — but a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers has said that number might be much higher. It is also almost impossible to accurately determine a fatality rate because New York facilities do not have to report the number of positive cases, The Times pointed out in its analysis.
Cuomo has faced widespread criticism over a controversial order to forbid nursing homes from turning away coronavirus-infected patients from hospitals, which is widely blamed for the wild spread among residents. The policy was partially repealed in May.
Cuomo insisted that Empire State seniors who need care are now safer in nursing homes than they would be at home.
“We’re testing every week every nursing home employee,” he said. “So you could argue that they are safer than a senior citizen at home, who is receiving care at home.”
Cuomo also heralded the latest figures for New York. Just five deaths were reported in the state Saturday, while hospitalizations are now below 800.
But he said he feared that the alarming surge in cases in other states could destroy all the progress.
“If these states keep going up, we’re going to have a national crisis like we have never seen,” he warned. “I’m afraid the infection rate in the other states will come back to New York and raise that rate again.”
That could also affect the planned re-opening of schools at the start of the next school year, he admitted.
“We have plans to open schools. But … it’s two months away. Anything can happen in two months,” he said. “If this continues across the country … kids are going to be home for a long time.”
Cuomo blamed President Trump and his team for being “basically in denial,” saying, “They don’t want to tell the American people the truth.”

“Yesterday, the cathedral was completely sanitized,” the Catholic leader, who walked onto the altar in a white mask, assured the smattering of worshippers in the pews for the live-streamed service.
The Manhattan church had tweeted out video of cleaning crews in hazmat-like suits sanitizing it Saturday.
“I sometimes think we’re getting ready for surgery instead of Mass. But it’s essential, isn’t it,” Dolan told the worshippers, who were required to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart from non-family members for the famed church’s first public Mass in two and a half months.
Crowd capacity was limited to 25 percent for the service, although church Msgr. Robert Ritchie indicated that there were fewer people in attendance, saying in his opening remarks, “Obviously, there is no problem [with social distancing] today.
“We hope at some time we will have many, many more actual parishioners,” he said.
An archdiocese spokesman, Joe Zwilling, later told The Post that there were about 300 people, including congregants, priests and media, at the service, meaning there could have been up to 200 more.
During the service, Ritchie asked worshippers to pray for a church usher who died Saturday. Zwilling said he did not believe that the usher died from COVID-19.
No programs were handed out at the beginning of Mass, and the priests wore masks as they gave out Communion.
“It’s just been so haunting these last 14 sundays, including Palm Sunday and Easter  Sunday and Penatcost, to offer Mass in an empty church,” Dolan said in his closing remarks, noting that services had only been live-streamed up till this point because of the virus.
“That’s why I’m so overjoyed to see you all this morning.
“The church, of course, was never empty,” Dolan said of St. Pat’s when it was closed to the public for Mass. “The church was filled with the love of God.
“Thank God we have a lord who brings us together.”"

Florida continued to record high coronavirus numbers Sunday — adding more than 8,500 new cases to its statewide tally, according to a report.
The Sunshine State logged 8,530 new infections, bringing its total to 141,075 COVID-19 cases, NBC Miami reported.
Sunday’s tally comes just one day after the state set a daily record for new cases with 9,585 infections.
It marked the third day in a row that the state had seen more than 8,500 cases.
Over the past seven days, there have been a total of 43,784 new cases — which accounts for more than 30 percent of the state’s patients since the pandemic began, the outlet reported.
There were also 29 additional deaths reported Sunday, bringing the statewide death toll to 3,419, the report said.
Gov. Ron DeSantis said Friday that he still doesn’t plan to issue a statewide order requiring masks — insisting the measure is best handled at the local levels.
But he did call on younger people to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus to their older family members and others who have underlying medical conditions.
“While this may not be affecting you negatively, you can pass it along to other folks,” he said.

424,HHS Sec. Azar says ‘window is closing’ to curb coronavirus surge,https://nypost.com/2020/06/28/hhs-sec-azar-says-window-is-closing-to-curb-coronavirus-surge/,2020-06-28 00:00:00,"The secretary of Health and Human Services said Sunday the “window is closing” to curb the surge of coronavirus cases — and encouraged all Americans to follow the government’s guidelines about social distancing and mask wearing.
“So we’ve got the tools to do this … but the window is closing. We have to act, and people as individuals have to act responsibly. We need to social-distance. We need to wear our face-coverings if we’re in settings where we can’t social-distance, particularly in these hot zones,” Secretary Alex Azar said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview Sunday.
Azar said that in many southern states where the virus is spiking — including Florida and Texas — the majority of the cases are people under 35, and a large number of those will be asymptomatic.
“We’ve got our fatality rates and our hospitalization rates are the lowest they’ve been in two months, but this is a very serious situation,” he said.
Azar said the administration is working with local authorities and states to understand why the virus is surging in certain areas.
He noted that treatments like steroids and Remdesivir are now available for COVID-19, and encouraged people who have had the virus to donate plasma to increase the supply.
He said the surge in cases isn’t about which states have reopened or are reopening their economies.
“We’ve got many communities in states that are just as reopened as these southern states but aren’t experiencing this,” Azar said.
“We’ve got to get to the bottom of why we’re seeing these cases surge in this area, but at its core, we all own as individuals, our individual behavior to make sure that we are practicing appropriate social distancing and wearing facial covering when we’re not able to, and practicing good personal hygiene and especially protecting our most vulnerable citizens.”
Asked by host Chuck Todd why President Trump doesn’t wear a mask, Azar said Trump is constantly tested.
“The president, we know, is a very unique circumstance as leader of the free world. He’s tested constantly and those around him are tested constantly and they’re kept at a distance even with that,” he said, adding that people should follow the administration’s guidelines on how to combat the coronavirus."

A married Virginia couple was busted trying to flee the country after they illegally received nearly $1.5 million in federal funds meant for struggling businesses during the pandemic, prosecutors said.
Monica Magdalena Jaworska, 43, and her husband, Tarik Jaafar, 42, were arrested at JFK Airport in New York for the alleged scam earlier this month after buying one-way tickets to Poland, according to US Attorney’s Office Eastern District of Virginia.
Prosecutors allege the pair filed 18 different loan applications under the federal Paycheck Protection Program, using bogus IRS forms to claim they were supporting dozens of employees.
They were ultimately approved for four loans totaling more than $1.4 million, prosecutors said.
But an investigation revealed the businesses didn’t really exist, according to an affidavit filed by the Small Business Administration.
The couple bought the plane tickets after officers contacted them for an interview, prosecutors said.
Most of the funds were frozen but prosecutors said Jaafar was able to withdraw at least $30,000 in cash.
Jaworska appeared in court Friday afternoon on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
If convicted, both she and Jaafar face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison."

The leader of a group that fought against Maryland’s coronavirus lockdown measures is now seriously sick from the contagion — but refusing to help contact tracers, according to reports.
Tim Walters, the co-founder of ReOpen Maryland, whose protests included flashmobs of people without masks, revealed in a video that he “crashed” last Wednesday and “had to go to the emergency room.”
“I thought I was actually having a stroke … turns out I had COVID,” he said, asking for prayers.
Walters, a two-time Republican candidate for the General Assembly, warned friends to keep an eye on possible symptoms — but insisted he would not help official contact tracers, according to Capital Gazette.
“I will not share anybody’s information with the government. I will not do it,” he said in other since-deleted videos, according to Capital Gazette.
“I did the right thing and contacted everyone I could think of that I had contact with … I don’t know what more the Government could do,” he later told Wrongthink Radio. “It isn’t my business to give other people’s information to the government.”
He later told Maryland’s Daily Record that he had to remove some of his videos because his wife and son were targeted with “vitriolic messages,” with some praying for his family’s death, he said.
Despite how sick he felt, he said it “hasn’t changed” his views against the lockdowns.
“In the end, I think everyone is going to get it, anyway,” he told the Daily Record.
“I knew this was a possibility and I got sick. OK, I’m going to take accountability for it,” he told the paper.
Walters also insisted it has not changed his view on masks, saying “there’s too much proof that masks don’t work.”
“They’re not really going to do anything,” he told the Daily Record, insisting he has “no idea” how or when he got sick.
Calling the contagion “capricious,” he also called it Satan’s attempt to “stifle my voice.”
Instead, he plans to continue preaching his message on social media, he said — including his ongoing resolve to fight official stay-at-home and mask-wearing orders.
“We have to decide as a nation if this fear is worth our liberties because once we lose them, we don’t get them back,” he said.
“Anybody that’s waiting for the government to tell them to do the right thing because they couldn’t figure it out, they’re going to be sorely disappointed,” Walters said."

The coronavirus pandemic hit a grim milestone Sunday with 10 million cases worldwide — and the death toll closing in on 500,000, data shows.
As of Sunday morning, Johns Hopkins University data which has long tracked the contagion listed 10,004,643 confirmed cases, with 499,296 deaths worldwide.
More than a quarter of both counts came from the US, which as of Sunday had seen 2,510,323 confirmed cases and 125,539 deaths, the data shows.
The US recorded more than 42,000 cases Saturday, the data shows — lower than the record 45,255 recorded Friday, but the second straight day that there have been more than 40,000 new cases.
The data reports only confirmed cases — and experts fear the true figure is likely far higher, with many people unable to get tested or carrying the bug without symptoms.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that as many as 10 times more Americans may be infected — which would mean as many as 20 million may have contracted the virus in the US alone."

In the U.S., Vice President Mike Pence called off off a planned campaign bus tour in Florida following a surge in confirmed cases there. Hard-hit Italy, meanwhile, registered the lowest day-to-day tally of COVID-19 deaths Saturday in almost three months.
No positive cases were found in Beijing’s beauty and barbershops in a further sign that the city’s recent outbreak has been largely brought under control.
Beijing officials have temporarily shut a huge wholesale food market where the virus spread widely, reclosed schools and locked down some neighborhoods. Anyone leaving Beijing is required to have a negative virus test result within the previous seven days.
Tens of millions of Chinese traveled during the three-day Dragon Boat Festival that ended Saturday, with no outbreaks reported immediately.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that 40 of the newly reported cases were domestically infected, while 22 others came from overseas. The bulk of the local cases were detected in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, linked to nightclubs, church services, a huge e-commerce warehouse and low-income workers.
In Hawaii, the city of Honolulu announced that campgrounds will reopen for the first time in three months with limited permits to ensure social distancing. In contrast, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee put a hold on plans to move counties to the fourth phase of his reopening plan as cases continue to increase.
In a further sign of the impact on the U.S economy, Tyson Foods has announced that 371 employees at its chicken processing plant in the far southwestern corner of Missouri have tested positive for COVID-19.
Pence canceled a planned bus tour in Florida to benefit his and President Donald Trump’s reelection, as state health officials on Saturday reported more than 9,500 new cases, surpassing the previous day’s total by more than 600 confirmed cases. The figures come as officials move to reclose beaches and discourage bar gatherings.
Kansas, Idaho and Oklahoma were also among U.S. states seeing a sharp rise in case.
While the rise partly reflects expanded testing, experts say there is ample evidence the scourge is making a comeback, including increasing deaths and hospitalizations in parts of the country and higher percentages of virus tests coming back positive."

TMZ published pair of photos showing Parker playing tennis without a mask, and said the photos were taken earlier that day.
The outlet also reported, “Jabari was recently seen out at a restaurant there in the Windy City.”
While it is unknown exactly when Parker tested positive or the current status of his recovery, the club released a statement to the Sacramento Bee on Saturday afternoon after the TMZ report surfaced.
“We are aware of the report and are gathering additional information,” the statement read. “We have no further comment at this time.”
The NBA requires any player who tests positive for COVID-19 to refrain from physical activity for a minimum of 14 days.
Parker, 25, said in a statement Wednesday he tested positive for COVID-19 “several days ago” and that he was isolating in Chicago. He added he planned to join his teammates next month at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando, Fla., when the NBA season resumes.
Teammate Alex Len also announced Wednesday that he, too, tested positive for the virus. Fellow Kings player Buddy Hield also reportedly tested positive for COVID-19, though neither the Kings nor Hield have made any announcement.
Teams will begin arriving in Florida for training camp by July 11, and the season will resume July 30.

430,Side dish becomes side app: Gig economy providing needed income for chefs,https://nypost.com/2020/07/05/theres-a-cook-for-that-apps-providing-needed-income-for-chefs/,2020-07-05 00:00:00,"There’s a gig economy for everything these days, including gourmet cooking.
Plenty of new apps are cropping up to help chefs earn extra income during the coronavirus pandemic by cooking or teaching about cooking — and they’re attracting some big name talent.
On Monday, Franklin Becker, co-founder of restaurant chain The Little Beet, will launch 100 Pleats, an interactive foodie app that he’d like to see as the Uber for chefs who are making their own schedule and working when they want to.
The app — named after the number of pleats in a chef’s hat — offers a platform for chefs to sell their cooking expertise through virtual sessions that might cost $10 for ten minutes or $500 — or more — for up to 120 minutes.
Each chef sets his or her price and pockets 80 percent, and the app gets the rest.
100 Pleats is based on the idea of customers paying chefs for their valuable time — whether to answer a few questions or to teach a group of friends to cook a meal. There also are classes for kids.
“You can ask [the chefs] anything, like what should you make for dinner, or what to do with the ingredients that you already have in your fridge,” Becker says.
So far, participating chefs include Emma Bengtsson, the first female Swedish chef to win two Michelin stars, Michelin-starred George Mendes, Maria Loi of Loi Estiatorio, an upscale Greek restaurant below Central Park, Mexican cuisine specialist Sue Torres and Indian food star Chintan Pandya.
Meanwhile, chefs working to fill their time — and income gaps — during the pandemic also are flocking to food-subscription apps like CookUnity.
When Mateo Marietti co-founded CookUnity in 2016, it was designed as a test kitchen in Brooklyn for trained chefs who did not have their own kitchens or restaurants — a kind of WeWork for chefs.
Marietti still has the kitchen, but the business strategy has pivoted to helping chefs earn extra income with their restaurants being closed or doing reduced business because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The weekly subscription platform allows diners to order meals from the chef of their choice, including weekly menu options from their restaurants and cookbooks. Dishes vary in price from $10.99 up to $16. Delivery started in New York and now is available across the Northeast and parts of New England.
Since March, more than a dozen new chefs have been added to the site, including chef maestro Jean-Georges Vongerichten, his son Cedric Vongerichten, as well as Joseph “JJ” Johnson, a James Beard Foundation Book Award-winning chef.
Johnson said he was inspired to join after seeing the success that other chefs have had on the app, including Cedric Vongerichten, the executive chef and owner of Wayan, a French-influenced Indonesian hotspot. Cedric also helms the kitchen at Jean-Georges’ West Village restaurant, Perry Street.
The elder Vongerichten joined after the lockdown hampered business at Wayan, but he says he’s leaning toward staying long after a vaccine is discovered. “I think people will continue to want to eat at home,” he told Side Dish.
Johnson is on track to start cooking for CookUnity in August.
“We’re trying to tap into a new network. The goal is to reach out beyond my restaurant, to people who watch my cooking show but who can’t get to the restaurant,” says Johnson of Field Trip, a pan-African rice-based eatery in Harlem."
431,NYC grocers struggle to hire while workers bank on unemployment claims,https://nypost.com/2020/07/05/nyc-grocers-struggle-to-hire-while-workers-fleece-on-unemployment/,2020-07-05 00:00:00,"New York City supermarkets are getting inundated with unemployment claims — while most of them are looking to hire workers during the coronavirus lockdown, not fire them.
Morton Williams, which operates 16 stores in the New York metro area, was slammed with 400 claims at the height of the pandemic in March and April — up tenfold from a year earlier, co-owner Steven Sloan told The Post. Through June, claims have risen to about 600 — or about half the workers on the payroll, he said.
What’s more, during that time Sloan said Morton Williams has laid off only three people as grocery demand went through the roof. Yet by the end of May, more than 160 ex-staffers were drawing weekly benefits OK’d by the state, he said.
In the past, it was rare that the New York Department of Labor would pay a claim the supermarket disputed, and if they did, they would explain themselves, Sloan said.
That practice changed with the outbreak of the coronavirus, he said.
“In three months I have not received a single explanation about why former employees are being paid when I have disputed their claims,” Sloan told The Post. “So, I don’t know what their reasoning is. I can’t argue any of these cases if we don’t know what the rules are.”
With the federal government’s CARES Act paying out $600 a week on top of state unemployment checks, many grocery workers stand to make more on unemployment than they would working at the store. That has helped to spur a tidal wave of claim applications, and the city’s grocers — which have boasted steady business since mid-March — say they’re struggling to deal with the situation.
“We are seeing confusing claims from people who haven’t notified us that they are leaving,” said Sal Bonavita, who owns two Key Food stores in the Bronx. “We haven’t laid off anyone and yet we are seeing much higher volumes of unemployment claims.”
“The benefits are a key reason why people are not applying for jobs at our stores right now,” he added. He usually has 16 employees but is currently short eight staffers.
The CARES Act, passed by Congress in March, also releases benefits to workers who claim they are caring for a family member with COVID-19, or to those who are the primary caregiver for a child.
Those changes — combined with the federal stimulus checks for taxpayers — have spurred some workers to seize the advantage.
Sloan said two young store clerks recently filed for benefits even though they are still working for Morton Williams. When they were confronted by a manager they “admitted they had filed for unemployment, explaining that they were told if you file you can get extra money,” Sloan said.
Back in April, Sloan added, a cashier got fired for failing to charge a customer for $200 worth of groceries, and soon started receiving state checks for $284 per week, despite the chain disputing the claim.
An employee at a Midtown location quit his job in March after telling his boss he was worried about his own health safety, citing the pandemic. He started receiving weekly checks of $341 — despite the supermarket’s protestations, Sloan said.
Indeed, workers who quit their jobs or are fired from them shouldn’t qualify workers for benefits, said Deanna Cohen, a spokesperson for the New York Department of Labor, adding that “if someone misrepresents their situation to get benefits they are committing fraud.”
“We have a rigorous application and screening process to weed out fraudulent claims and ensure only eligible New Yorkers receive benefits,” Cohen said via email. “This system has not changed during this crisis.”
Adding to the confusion, organized crime rings have been filing fraudulent claims on behalf of people who are currently working, according to reports. Sloan said he has encountered the problem in a handful of instances in which he has received claims for employees who never stopped working and told him that they did not file a claim.
“There is no guidance from state governments on how premiums will be impacted,” labor lawyer Darren Oved of Oved & Oved LLP told The Post. “Unemployment insurance rates will go up almost certainly.”"
432,NFL training camp rules set high bar for players to return from coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/07/05/nfl-training-camp-protocols-set-high-bar-for-coronavirus-return/,2020-07-05 00:00:00,"With NFL players and coaches scheduled to finally reunite in just over three weeks, the league sent a memo to all teams Friday detailing COVID-19 protocol for training camp and the preseason.
Developed in association with the NFL Players Association, the memo from commissioner Roger Goodell features the steps teams must take regarding treatment and testing of the novel coronavirus.
Teams will need to perform contact tracing if any person tests positive or possesses symptoms of the virus. Any person in the proximity of an infected individual will be required to be tested for eight straight days — regardless of the test result — while a person who tests positive must remain away from the team facility for at least 10 days, unless testing negative twice in a five-day span after a positive test. Doctors must clear any person who tests positive, before returning to the site.
During training camp, players and coaches will be asked to conduct meetings virtually or outdoors. All team employees will be required to wear masks inside the facility, while players and staff must perform social distancing of at least six feet from each other, even inside the locker room. Strength and conditioning workouts will be capped at 15 people, while teams are permitted to have as many as 110 people — all required to wear masks — in a traveling party for a road game.
An agreement has not yet been reached regarding players’ ability to opt out of the season due to health concerns, which multiple NBA, MLB and NHL players have already done. The NFLPA reportedly voted to entirely cancel the two-game preseason — which was already cut in half — in order to make up for the in-person team workouts and camps missed during the spring and summer.
Though fans and visitors will not be permitted to attend training camp, the league is allowing teams to hold as many as two events with fans at their respective stadium, if local health regulations allow it. In such a scenario, fans would be dispersed throughout the building and not be permitted to sit in the first eight rows. Media members will not be allowed to interview players in person.
All team employees are subject to discipline should anyone refuse to follow health and safety protocols. Both the league and NFLPA are authorized to make surprise inspections to enforce the new policies."

Tattoo parlors are among the Big Apple businesses set to start up again Monday under Phase 3 of the state’s reopening plan — and the coronavirus is already a sought-after design.
“I had a group of nurses and doctors, who were in town to help out, e-mail me asking about a [COVID-related] group tattoo,’’ Paul Paz, assistant manager of the Bang Bang Tattoo shops in Lower Manhattan, told The Post on Sunday.
Another customer also e-mailed asking for a tat of “COVID, the virus, the picture of the actual virus,’’ he said.
In addition to tattoo parlors, nail and tanning salons and spas in the Big Apple are allowed to start up again under Phase 3, and people can also officially begin playing some outdoor sports.
Paz said his business is trying to figure out how to work through a backlog of appointments that were canceled because of the shutdown.
“We still have two and a half months of appointments to reschedule. They put in a deposit, they have priority,’’ he said. “Once they are contacted, we will start taking new customers.’’
NYC Tan near Willowbrook Park on Staten Island said its customers are also ready to bust down its doors, with at least six appointments already lined up Monday.
“We have face shields, we have masks, we have temperature guns,” owner John Carandola told The Post. “Front door stays locked, and we will take temperatures at the entrance.”
Mark Harada, the owner of New York Hardcore Tattoo in SoHo in Manhattan, said he was busy trying to reorganize his small, long and narrow spot on Stanton Street to ensure proper social distancing.
He said the artist working Monday already has three appointments.
“The biggest change is no walk-ins,’’ Harada said. “We will have actually one person working at a time with one customer. Friends are not allowed.
But other shops were expecting a slower return to business as usual.
“A lot of people are not in town. People are scared’’ of getting the virus, Kim Dong, manager of Aria Body Piercing in the East Village, told The Post.
Harada acknowledged that he is “cautiously optimistic’’ about reopening.
“We could be a vector for disease, so we have to be very careful. We don’t want to be shut down again,’’ the shop owner said, referring to the citywide lockdown that took effect in March amid the pandemic.
“I’m skeptical about how safe we could be, as I am skeptical about restaurants and bars reopening.’’
Indoor restaurant dining would typically be allowed under the state’s Phase 3 guidelines, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo nixed it for New York City amid fears over soaring virus figures in other states and the lack of social distancing in the Big Apple outside places such as bars."

Dr. Stephen Hahn told CNN’s “State of the Union” that the Department of Health and Human Services will hand out the medication “to the areas that most need it.”
“We have been in touch with the states and the localities to surge remdesivir to the areas that most need it,” Hahn said.
“And we are receiving that feedback and then shipping remdesivir, so that it’s available for people who need it.”
Researchers have found the drug can speed recovery in COVID-19 patients.
Some Sun Belt states, including Florida and Texas, have recently seen an increase in coronavirus cases, which Hahn called “a concerning trend.”
“This virus is still with us,” Hahn said, adding that “this is why the public health message about how to protect yourself and others is so important.”
But, he said, the US is in a “fundamentally different place” than it was in March or April, in part thanks to drugs like remdesivir.
“We have new therapeutics that we didn’t have at the time, so treatments, remdesivir, steroids, and this plasma program, where over 28,000 people have been treated,” he said.
“So, those are the sort of things that are different,” he continued. “More testing capacity, more therapeutics and those things are, so fundamentally different, but still a concerning trend.”
He added that: “Really, we can stop this by following the guidelines.”"

A New York man who was captured in a famous photograph fleeing the debris of a crumbling World Trade Center on 9/11 has died from the coronavirus.
Stephen Cooper, 78, who was living part-time in Florida, succumbed to the virus March 28 at Delray Medical Center, The Palm Beach Post reported over the weekend.
Cooper was 60 years old when he was photographed running among a crowd just a block away from the south tower, carrying a manila envelope under his left arm.
The image taken by Associated Press photographer, Suzanne Plunkett, ran in newspapers and magazines around the world — and now is on display at the 9/11 Memorial Museum in Manhattan.
Janet Rashes, who was Cooper’s partner for 33 years, said he was delivering documents near the World Trade Center when he heard a police officer yell, “You have to run.”
“He didn’t even know the photograph was taken,” she told The Palm Beach Post. “All of a sudden, he’s looking in Time magazine one day and he sees himself and says, ‘Oh my God. That’s me.’ He was amazed. Couldn’t believe it.”
The couple’s daughter, Jessica Rashes, said her Bronx-born dad kept a copy of the magazine that he would take out on the anniversary of September 11.
“Every year on 9/11, he would go looking for the magazine and say, ’Look, it’s here again,” she said. “He would bring it to family barbecues, parties, anywhere he could show it off.”
Plunkett, the photographer behind the image, said she didn’t know Cooper’s identity until his death.
“It is a shame I was never aware of the identity of Mr. Cooper,” Plunkett wrote after his death in an email to The Palm Beach Post.

During a discussion about the possible timetable for developing a vaccine, Hahn was asked what happens if all of those people refuse.
“It is a sizable number. And it is concerning. And, of course, the issue of vaccines in this country has been around for a number of years,” he said on ABC News’ “This Week.”
“What I can say is, one of the major reasons we issued this guidance was we wanted to give clarity about what we were going to look at, what we need to look at, and that FDA — the nation’s FDA — has incredible scientific expertise and we will do our job to assess the safety and the efficacy of a vaccine candidate,” he continued.
“I want to assure the American people of that and provide confidence that we’re on the job.”
The ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 27 percent were wary of getting a vaccine. Of those, half said they don’t trust vaccines and 23 percent said they didn’t think it was necessary.
But 71 percent of respondents said they “definitely” or “probably” would get a COVID-19 vaccine.
Hahn said a vaccine was being developed with “unprecedented” speed — but stopped short of President Trump’s prediction on Saturday that one could be ready before the end of the year.
“I can’t predict when a vaccine will be available. And I just want to tell you about FDA’s role in this. Yes, we are seeing unprecedented speed for the development of a vaccine,” Hahn said.
“But as you know … we issued guidance this past week about vaccine development because we want to be very clear, our solemn promise to the American people is that we will make a decision based upon the data and science on a vaccine with respect to the safety and effectiveness of that vaccine.”"
437,NJ Gov. Phil Murphy: Make face masks ‘national requirement’,https://nypost.com/2020/07/05/nj-gov-phil-murphy-make-face-masks-national-requirement/,2020-07-05 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday there should be a “national requirement” that everyone wear face masks amid the coronavirus.
“It’s become almost not even debatable,” the governor told NBC TV’s “Meet the Press.” “Certainly when you’re going out and absolutely indoors. As I mentioned, this virus is a lot more lethal inside than outside. But if you’re leaving your house, put on a mask. I think it ought to be a national, a national requirement.”
Many states, including New Jersey, require face masks in stores, as well as outdoors when proper social distancing can’t be maintained. At least some states that previously hadn’t required masks indoors are now seeing a spike in cases.
In Texas, residents still are only required to wear masks in public places in counties with 20 or more current COVID-19 cases, while North Carolina allows those under age 11 to not wear masks.
New York City has had to put some of its reopening plans on hold — including indoor restaurant dining — because of concern over coronavirus surges in other states. New Jersey also delayed indoor dining.
“We went through hell. We cannot afford to go through hell again,” Murphy told NBC.
“We need a national strategy now, and masking has to be the core of that,” he added."

“It’s clear that the growth is exponential at this point,” Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said on ABC’s “This Week.” “You know we’ve been breaking record after record after record all in the last couple of weeks.”
Suarez, who agreed with Miami-Dade County’s decision to close beaches for the Fourth of July holiday weekend, blamed the rise in cases on the reopening of bars and restaurants.
“There’s no doubt that when we reopened, people started socializing as if the virus didn’t exist,” he said. “It’s extremely worrisome.”
The Republican mayor said he’s optimistic that closing the beaches, implementing stricter mask-wearing rules and hiking penalties against businesses that don’t abide by safety restrictions will curb the cases.
“If people are wearing the masks in public, there’s a very good chance that we’re going to be able to slow down or stop the spread. So that’s the reason why we do it,” he said.
Florida reported 10,059 cases on Sunday after reporting 11,458 cases on Saturday — the Sunshine State now has a total of 200,111 cases.
Meanwhile, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Sunday he is worried about running out of hospital beds.
“If we don’t get our hands around this virus quickly, our hospitals could be in serious, serious trouble,” he said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “The major problem is staffing … we can always provide additional beds, but we need the people, the nurses and everybody else in the medical profession to staff those beds.”
Texas reported 8,238 new cases on Saturday — bringing the state’s total cases to 191,790. Hospitalizations in Houston rose from 1,691 patients on June 27 to 2,369 a week later on July 4, according to the San Antonio Express News.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week issued an executive order requiring people to wear masks in public in certain counties and closed bars and reduced the seating capacity of restaurants.
Austin Mayor Steve Adler echoed Turner’s concerns that hospitals in his city could be flooded.
“If we don’t change the trajectory, then I am within two weeks of having our hospitals overrun. And in our ICUs, I could be 10 days away from that,” the Democrat said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”"

With a petty throwback to a more carefree version of 2020, when sign-stealing was baseball’s biggest concern, the Reds pitcher attempted to bring the Houston Astros’ scandal and their tainted 2017 title back into the spotlight.
As teams reconvened last week for spring training 2.0, Bauer tweeted a picture of himself wearing a shirt that reads “HOUSTON CHEATED,” “2017 CHUMPS” and “TRASH-TOWN.”
“Baseball is back everyone!! Intake testing done, lots of really high tech stuff goin on here but anything to help us win is in, right?!” Bauer wrote, with a not so subtle jab at Houston’s use of electronics to steal signs illegally when it won the World Series.

The Astros cheating scandal had taken a back seat to the battle between the owners and players union, which combined with coronavirus, led to a three-month postponement of Opening Day.
Due to the shortened 60-game regular season, which is set to begin later this month, the Reds could only face the Astros in the World Series."
440,Texas woman beats coronavirus — then delivers healthy triplets,https://nypost.com/2020/07/05/texas-woman-beats-coronavirus-then-delivers-healthy-triplets/,2020-07-05 00:00:00,"A pregnant Texas woman beat the coronavirus — then delivered healthy triplets weeks later.
“As a mom, you want control, but right now, you have to accept that you don’t have control of everything,” said the mother, only identified as Maggie, in a Facebook posting Friday.
According to the Women’s Hospital of Texas in Houston, where Maggie delivered her triplets, she learned she was COVID-19 positive after a routine check-up on May 8 when she was 28 weeks pregnant.
Maggie was given a test for the contagion at the time, which is protocol, and learned two days later — Mother’s Day — that she was positive for it, said a posting on the hospital’s Instagram page.
The post also included a photo of the beaming mom holding her now weeks’ old babies.
“Meet the #firecracker who beat #COVID19 during her 3rd trimester then delivered healthy #triplets with an attitude brighter than fireworks on the #FourthofJuly,” the hospital wrote next to the photo.
When she was first diagnosed, Maggie, who already has a 5-year-old son with her husband, was concerned about “everyone but herself,” the hospital said.
Over the next few weeks, she was given a total of five coronavirus tests, the hospital added in its Facebook missive.
Then “On June 4 … with the final two [tests] negative, Maggie learned during her weekly ultrasound that “Baby A’s” cord was wrapped around her neck, and she would have a C-section that day at 4 p.m.,” the hospital said.
Her husband wasn’t allowed to be with her in the delivery room because he’d also previously tested positive for the virus, and while cleared in one follow-up test, he “hadn’t received his second negative test,” so her mother was her “one support person during labor,” the hospital said.
“At 4:51 p.m., “Baby A,” Isabella, was born at 3.11 lbs. At 4:53 p.m., “Baby B,” Nathaniel, was born at 3.7 lbs. Finally, at 4:55 p.m., “Baby C,” Adriel, was born at 2.1 lbs. ” the hospital said.
“The doctors and nurses were amazed by how well Maggie did. She and her babies, who arrived in perfect ABC order, were healthy, safe and undeniably resilient.”
Maggie told other mothers on the hospital’s Facebook page, “You have to let other people help you and remember you aren’t alone. Look forward to each day and celebrate every small victory.”
On June 9, Texas recorded its highest number of coronavirus-related hospitalizations since May 5, and the state has been locked in a battle since against soaring related figures."

Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia on Sunday said businesses can begin to reopen if safety precautions are followed, despite the rise of coronavirus cases in some states.
“We have new cases, we have to keep an eye on that, [but] I believe we can continue to reopen our workplaces safely,” Scalia said on “Fox News Sunday.”
“It is going to be important that people take social distancing seriously, wear masks in circumstances where they’re not able to social distance and the like,” he continued. “We can reopen safely, we can reopen while the virus is still there but it will get more challenging if people don’t take that seriously.”
Scalia expressed optimism about the US adding roughly 5 million jobs in June, promising retail spending numbers and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that took effect on July 1.
Asked about whether the country could see a V-shaped recovery, Scalia responded: “Those are the indications that we see.”
He also acknowledged that “there remain many Americans still out of work” and said the president is considering tax cuts.
Scalia said the Trump administration is prepared to deal with a rise in coronavirus cases as businesses open.
“We knew that as people came out of their homes, emerged from their basements and the like, we knew that cases would go up,” Scalia said. “We are far better prepared to deal with those cases now than we were a few months ago … we have the equipment, the hospital beds to deal with this situation.”
“This is something that we can manage,” he said."

Andrew Cuomo said.
The new cases statewide dropped to 533, closer to the state’s numbers before the spike on Friday, which was the highest since mid-June.
New infections were at 391 on June 29, then jumped to 918 on Friday, before falling again to 726 on July 4.
Eight coronavirus-related deaths were recorded on Sunday, bringing the statewide numbers to 32,157.
The new figures come after Cuomo encouraged New Yorkers on the Fourth of July to continue wearing masks.
“This July 4th remember — real patriots wear masks,” Cuomo wrote on Twitter."

444,Mets’ Seth Lugo on coronavirus threat: ‘You don’t live in fear’,https://nypost.com/2020/07/05/mets-seth-lugo-on-coronavirus-threat-you-dont-live-in-fear/,2020-07-05 00:00:00,"Sitting out the abbreviated season never crossed Seth Lugo’s mind. Not even with a recently born child and the novel coronavirus pandemic continuing to spread throughout the country.
“I live my life to play baseball,” the valuable right-hander said on a Zoom call Saturday afternoon, as the Mets continued spring training 2.0 at Citi Field. “When they said we were playing, I was ready to go.”
While players like David Price, Ryan Zimmerman, Ian Desmond and Mike Leake have opted out already due to a variety of health reasons, and Mike Trout and Bryce Harper have raised concerns, the Mets players who have talked to the media have said they are all in. Lugo, in particular, seems comfortable with the precautions that are being taken. The Mets are staggering workouts and limiting the amount of players on the field together at the same time.
“I personally have the belief you don’t live in fear,” said Lugo — the Mets’ best reliever a year ago, with a 2.70 ERA and 104 strikeouts in 80 innings pitched. “I’m not focused on that. I’m focused on executing pitches and doing my job to the best of my ability. That’s my No. 1 concern.
“We have a responsibility to do what’s been told to us. We’ve had meetings on protocols and safe ways to do stuff. As long as we abide by that stuff, I’m very confident it will be safe.”
The timing of spring training getting canceled due to the pandemic couldn’t have worked out better for Lugo. It gave him the chance to get home three days before the birth of his son James on March 19 and spend the time with his child at home in Louisiana, when he would typically be away playing baseball. He did stay in shape, running and throwing frequently. He long-tossed and threw bullpen sessions with friends multiple times a week. So though the season is a few weeks away, Lugo isn’t concerned about his status.
“I feel like I’m ready to go,” he said. “I did face a couple of hitters during this break and I think my stuff was about mid-season form. So I’m ready to go.”
Though Lugo remains interested in being a starter, the plan for him is to remain in the bullpen barring injury. The Mets’ relief corps, a weakness in recent years, could be strong after the addition of former Yankee Dellin Betances and potential bounce-back years from formerly dominant relievers Edwin Diaz and Jeurys Familia, who both struggled mightily a year ago.
“I’m glad we’ve got so many good arms, so many different options and everybody is so much different from each other,” Lugo said. “I feel like we got so many different weapons. I think our bullpen is set to be really good if we can all stay healthy and perform as we should.”"
445,‘Super-human beast’ Pat Perez driving force in coronavirus aid effort,https://nypost.com/2020/07/12/pga-tour-golfer-pat-perez-driving-force-in-coronavirus-aid-effort/,2020-07-12 00:00:00,"Pat Perez is 44, has played on the PGA Tour since 2002, won three times and accumulated $26.7 million in career earnings on the golf course.
Along the way, he’s also made some noise as one of the most outspoken players in the game with his carefree demeanor, occasional quick temper and his look — long dark hair cascading down his shoulders from the back of his flat-brimmed ballcap.
Perez, after shooting a 4-under 68 in Thursday’s opening round of the Workday Charity Open, shot 72 in each of the next three rounds to finish tied for 39th at Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio.
In the recent months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Perez quietly has been making a difference off the golf course, helping to raise millions of dollars to supply front-line workers with personal protective equipment when it’s been in dangerously short supply.
Because Perez’s personality is so big, he knows more people than most, which is the reason he’s been such a linchpin in helping during this crisis.
Through a mutual acquaintance, Perez, who lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., met Brent Skoda, the chairman of Urgent Response Network, in March when COVID-19 was at its early height of crisis in the U.S.
Skoda brainstormed an idea to raise money to produce PPE for the front-line workers and, in Skoda’s words, with the help of Perez and his high-profile connections the project “grew like wildfire.’’
Before the end of March, they had raised more than $12 million and “moved millions of units of PPE,’’ according to Skoda, who only met Perez for the first time in March.
“Our first office in Arizona was at Pat’s house,’’ Skoda told The Post by phone recently. “Pat was immediately super-inspired by what we were doing and felt like this was a real need to be addressed. Pat knows that he has a pretty powerful network. He and I wrote a letter to President Trump, we wrote to [Canadian] Prime Minister [Justin] Trudeau and the president of Mexico [Andrés Manuel López Obrador] and outlined the protocol with what we’re doing.
“Pat opened up his network, his connections in the state of Arizona, and leveraged his network to try to help. He has an unlimited Rolodex. Pat is one of the only Mexican-Americans on the PGA Tour, so he was well-supported for this platform.’’
The PPE they acquired came from Mexico and was trucked to Arizona.
“Pat is a super-human beast,’’ Skoda said. “He’s perfect for us. Pat’s whole MO is no BS and straight to the point.’’
Perez downplayed his part in the project and pushed credit to Skoda for coming up with the idea and executing it.
“Brent and his team were creating this Urgent RN, we got to talking, he said they had access to this PPE stuff,’’ Perez told The Post. “All I’ve done is reach out to people because I felt like I could help. I have the time and I have the Rolodex to help out. That’s been my involvement in it. I’m not banging the phones. I’m here to try to help make introductions and try to help out the state of Arizona and hopefully even more.’’
Arizona is one the U.S. states, along with California, Texas and Florida, where COVID-19 cases have been spiking, increasing the need for the PPE for the front-line workers.
“All I’m doing is help get leads,’’ Perez said. “I’ve got a lot of people I know who are hurting. I’ve reached out to CEO friends to help. I have a platform here. I’ve been in Arizona for 22 years, went to Arizona State and I know a lot of people in this town. I don’t really have any stake in the game. I’m just trying to help out.’’
As we’ve learned in this time of crisis, every little bit helps."
446,How Nets are dealing with nearly unrecognizable roster,https://nypost.com/2020/07/12/how-nets-are-dealing-with-nearly-unrecognizable-nba-restart-roster/,2020-07-12 00:00:00,"Everybody in the NBA bubble is dealing with coronavirus fears, ever-changing practice sites and times. But from trying to cobble together a roster to having to switch up their system on the fly, for the Nets, the rest of this season is all about handling adversity and staying flexible.
Being able to bend without breaking will determine how well they do in the league restart later this month.
“I can complain right now if I really wanted to. I can complain that I have these gloves on,” interim coach Jacque Vaughn said via Zoom, wearing black gloves for coronavirus protection.
“But that’s not the way I’m asking this team to live their lives. That’s a good challenge right now. We’re going to invest, put dividends into not complaining and accepting this situation and making the most of it.”
The situation is this: With the Nets without seven players because of either injury or the virus — and none of the replacements available yet — they’re desperately short on bodies.
“At the end of the day we will have a roster, and we’re just kind of working through the process of getting there,” said Vaughn, who has been forced to make schematic changes on both ends of the court.
With coronavirus costing the Nets four players in the past couple of weeks, the plans Vaughn had made suddenly had to be scrapped and redrawn for a roster now bereft of size or firepower.
“The biggest adjustment we made was streamlining and making things more simple, just because of the different bodies we’re going to have,” Vaughn said. “The hiatus plan that we had wrapped up in a nice box and now, we won’t be able to unwrap and see all of that.”
Spencer Dinwiddie, DeAndre Jordan and Taurean Prince tested positive for coronavirus and Wilson Chandler opted out over COVID concerns. Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Nic Claxton are hurt.
“You look at our roster, and you’ve got to be realistic about the fact we’re not going to out-talent a lot of teams we’re playing against. We’re definitely limited,” Joe Harris admitted. “But one thing we can control is not beating ourselves, make sure everybody’s executing and mentally engaged, making the right decisions.”
Right now, Jarrett Allen is the only healthy big man, leaving Rodions Kurucs their second-biggest player at 6-foot-9, 228 pounds.
The Nets added 6-9 forwards Michael Beasley and Donta Hall, but both have to clear quarantine, and Beasley is suspended for five games. They’re close to a deal for 6-8 ex-Knick Lance Thomas, first reported by SNY, but he’s neither tall nor a prolific rebounder.
This Hobbit-sized roster is going to require schematic juggling.
“You look at our roster, we’re obviously limited in terms of size and having bigs right now,” Harris said. “And even when we add some of the guys that we’re bringing on, we’re still going to be in the same boat.
“So a lot of the emphasis is going to be on playing fast, switching a lot more frequently, trying to be up the line, pressure guys more defensively, and just try to get ourselves in advantageous situations where we’re getting the ball and going in transition offensively.”
Harris said the frontcourt situation will likely force him to play some power forward, and even 6-7, 220-pound guard Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot has alluded to playing some forward.
From having to learn new schemes, try new positions and switch practice times from morning to dinnertime to mid-day, the Nets are just going to have to adjust on the fly.
“We’ve all been warned coming into it to level our expectations for what’s traditionally what is a normal routine,” Harris said. “It’s all just about being flexible while we’re here.”"

The data from the New York City health department released Sunday recorded no COVID-19 fatalities on Saturday — the first time since March 13 that no deaths of the virus were reported in the Big Apple.
Officials tallied two probable deaths from the disease on Friday, though there weren’t any confirmed COVID-19 fatalities on that day either.
The city lost its first resident to the virus on March 11.
Since then, 18,669 people were confirmed to have succumbed to the illness, in addition to the 4,613 probable COVID-19 deaths reported."
448,Nets in talks with ex-Knick Lance Thomas to join NBA restart roster,https://nypost.com/2020/07/12/nets-in-talks-with-ex-knick-lance-thomas-to-join-nba-restart-roster/,2020-07-12 00:00:00,"The shorthanded Nets are in talks to bring back Lance Thomas, The Post confirmed.
Decimated by injuries and coronavirus, the Nets have desperately been adding bodies. Thomas, who was born in Brooklyn, would be their fourth replacement player, and unless someone else tests positive for COVID-19, their last.
The Nets had reportedly been close to adding Justin Anderson from G-League Long Island. When asked if adding Thomas would signal that somebody already in the NBA bubble is now unavailable or that they’ve opted against Anderson, interim coach Jacque Vaughn demurred.
“That’s a good one,” Vaughn said. “First, I’m not going to mess with HIPAA violations for that first part of it. Then second piece is, I can’t comment on guys that we actually haven’t signed yet.
“Not being secretive on my part, just being open and honest with where we are. At the end of the day, we will have a roster, and we’re just kind of working through the process of getting there.”
SNY was the first to report the talks.
Like Thomas, not only are replacements Michael Beasley and Jamal Crawford ex-Knicks, they also haven’t played in the NBA this season.
“We’ll have a couple guys who a month ago — four months ago — weren’t playing competitive basketball in the NBA. We understood that going in,” Vaughn said. “We’ve liked those players at different stages … so this opportunity presented itself to get them around us and get them in the fold.”
Thomas spent the preseason with the Nets. He played four-plus seasons with the Knicks and was their co-captain in 2017-18, but got waived last offseason to clear cap space for their failed pursuit of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
The St. Benedict’s Prep (N.J.) product is said to be close with both Durant and Beasley. His pinned tweet is a 2018 birthday greeting to Beasley.
Tyler Johnson — whose arrival had been delayed due to a personal matter — is now at Disney and has entered his quarantine period. He can join the Nets once that has finished.
Vaughn kept the same lineup for a second day: Chris Chiozza, Caris LeVert, Joe Harris, Rodions Kurucs and Jarrett Allen. He praised LeVert’s leadership, and is pressing Allen to be more vocal on defense with DeAndre Jordan out.
With players having a list of approved messages they can put on the back of their jerseys, Harris said he requested “Equality” as his No. 1 option and “Vote” as his second choice.
The NBA has set up a hospitality area for the players. They were able to watch some of the UFC fights, while Harris said he hopes to get in some golf with Garrett Temple on Tuesday’s off day."

The CUNY Board of Trustees of Trustees approved a resolution last week alerting 275,000-degree seeking students and 6,700 professors at its 25 colleges and professional schools that there’s a strong likelihood that most classes will be virtual rather than in-person at their campus when classes resume in September.
“The University, through this resolution, is recognizing that by reducing the density of individuals on the University campuses and offering the option of classes and support services in a primarily online and remote format, the University can better ensure the continued health, safety and welfare of its students faculty and staff,” the statement said.
The plan would also “preserve the availability of its physical spaces for those academic programs and support services that require them,” the resolution said.
For example, lab courses that require hands-on activity would be among courses that could be offered in person.
The resolution said CUNY officials would prefer more in-person classes and noted that New York has made great strides in reducing COVID-19 infections and deaths.
But, it added, “Pending the introduction of effective long-term health solutions, the COVID-19 pandemic public health emergency continues to be a concern in the State of New York and elsewhere throughout the United States, and in fact is showing recent signs of worsening as the number of new cases reported daily has reached record-setting levels.”
“The COVID-19 virus continues to pose a threat to the continuity of business and education …. The University’s highest priority in planning for the Fall 2020 semester is to protect the health and safety of students, faculty and staff while creating the conditions for our students to make progress in their academic programs.”
Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order back in March requiring all schools — including CUNY and SUNY institutions — to switch to virtual classes to help curb the spread of COVID-19.
Students and parents at some colleges have complained the online classes are inferior to in-person instruction and have demanded tuition refunds."
450,Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly moved at least 36 times during her year in hiding,https://nypost.com/2020/07/12/ghislaine-maxwell-moved-at-least-36-times-during-her-year-in-hiding/,2020-07-12 00:00:00,"Ghislaine Maxwell moved at least 36 times across the US in the year before her arrest — and coronavirus mask-wearing may have helped her stay undetected, a report said Sunday.
The British socialite took off from the West Coast and crisscrossed the country — making stops in Idaho, Wyoming and Colorado — before ultimately ending up in New Hampshire, where she was busted 10 days ago, The Sun reported.
“Ghislaine has been ­constantly on the move throughout the last year,” a source told the outlet. “She would stay in properties for a few days or a week.”
Her life on the lam appears to have begun after her pedophile ex-boyfriend, Jeffrey Epstein, killed himself last August in a Manhattan lockup while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, according to the paper.
The Sun’s source claimed that between then and her July 2 arrest, Maxwell hopped from home to home, moving at least three times each month.
While on the run, the accused madam mostly spent her days working out and reading — including a book on Epstein’s accusers by victims lawyer Bradley Edwards, in which she featured prominently, Vanity Fair previously reported.
The Sun’s source added: “She did go out, but not often.”
“Obviously, with the coronavirus, people were wearing masks — it made things easier for her.”
Officials have said they were tracking Maxwell’s movements — and had recently learned that she moved to a luxury home on a 156-acre estate in Bradford, NH, that she bought in an all-cash deal in December.
In an initial memo seeking Maxwell’s detention, prosecutors said she was “hiding out” in various locations in New England and had made efforts to go undetected, including switching her main phone number, which was registered under the name “G Max.”
But The Sun’s source said Maxwell moved around to outrun reporters — not federal authorities — echoing an argument made by her defense attorneys last week for why she was not a flight risk and should be granted bond.
“She was never running from the feds,” the source said. “She was ­running from journalists and crazy people who wanted to kill her.”
“It was a serious problem. Her location was on a need-to-know basis.”
Maxwell reportedly even hired a professional security firm to keep her safe amid an influx of death threats.

“It just feels like a bad dream that I can’t wake up from,” Jesse Byrd, the husband  of beloved late first-grade instructor Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd, 61, told the Arizona Republic.
His wife had previously retired, only to miss the classroom so much that she eventually returned to the job as a first-grade teacher in the Hayden-Winkelman Unified School District in Gila County.
In June, Kimberley and two other teachers — Angela Skillings and Jena Martinez-Inzunza — got together in one classroom to conduct classes for a group of kindergartners and first- and second-graders, who watched the educators online as they performed fun nature-inspired experiments such as using Cheetos to demonstrate bee pollination.
The women said they wore masks and gloves, socially distanced and used hand sanitizer to keep themselves safe, CNN reported.
“We were very careful,” Skillings told the Republic.
Kimberley — who suffered from diabetes, lupus and asthma — was the first to test positive for the virus, and by June 26, less than two weeks after she became a confirmed case, she was dead.
The two other teachers tested positive soon after Kimberley did and said they are still suffering from complications.
Arizona is among a slew of US states suffering from a recent surge in the virus.
The state reported 2,537 new cases of the contagion Sunday, for a current total of 122,467 — more than a third of which occurred just so far this month, according to statistics from Arizona’s Health Department.
There were another 86 deaths reported Sunday in Arizona, too, for a total of 2,237 fatalities. There were 69 deaths reported Saturday and 44 the day before. The highest daily death toll for the state was 177 fatalities Tuesday.
Most schools in the state had a reopening date of early August, until Gov. Doug Ducey said last month that they would be delayed until at least Aug. 17. Last week, Ducey only added that in-school learning would start up again “when it is safe,” the Republic reported.
State schools chief Kathy Hoffman wrote on Facebook on July 9, “Today, over 2,000 Arizonans have died from #COVID19. Among those is tragically Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd, a first-grade teacher in the Hayden-Winkelman Unified School District.
“Teachers’ dedication to serving students should not come at high risk. Arizona must do more to slow the spread of COVID19 and ensure a safe re-entry into our classrooms.”
District Superintendent Jeff Gregorich cited Kimberley’s death in arguing against the reopening of local schools in the traditional sense.
“I think [that] really the message or the concern that our staff has is, we can’t even keep our staff safe by themselves. … How are we going to keep 20 kids in a classroom safe?” he told CNN.
“I just don’t see how that’s possible to do that.”"

Florida has recorded the most new coronavirus cases of any state in a single day — more than 15,000 — shattering New York’s previous highest amount of 12,847 set at the height of the pandemic in April.
Nearly 143,000 people were tested for the deadly contagion in the Sunshine State on Saturday, or the most in a day in Florida since the end of June, the state’s Health Department said.
Still, while there were 15,299 confirmed Florida cases Saturday, or a positive rate of 11.25 percent, that percentage is below the state’s record Thursday of 18.39 percent and the lowest in days, a key fact to note, officials say.
There also were 45 deaths recorded Saturday in Florida from the virus, compared to 95 the day before.
The figures come as Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted calls for a statewide face-mask mandate — and said just last week that if Walmart is open, then local schools should reopen this fall, too.
The Republican National Convention is still on track to be held in Jacksonville next month."

A Florida woman took a dishwashing job at her husband’s nursing home after the facility barred visitors due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mary Daniel, 57, said she reached out to the staff at Rosecastle at Deerwood, an assisted living facility in Jacksonville, to see if she could volunteer or get a job there so she could see her spouse, Steve, TODAY reported.
“They said, ‘Let’s wait to see what happens,'” Daniel told the outlet.
“Then, out of the blue two weeks ago, they called and said, ‘Do you want a job?’ When I found out it was as a dishwasher, I thought, ‘Well, okay! I guess I’m a dishwasher now.'”
Daniel said she was required to take several coronavirus tests and undergo intense training before starting her part-time job.
“I had to have a background check, a drug test, a COVID test, 20 hours of video training on everything, including infectious diseases. It was 100 percent legit,” she said.
 
After 114 days apart, she was able to finally reunited with her 66-year-old husband, who has Alzheimer’s.
“I walked into his room and he said my name, he said Mary, which was also a relief,” Daniel told CNN. “So when he said, Mary, and gave me the biggest hug, I mean, we both cried.”
She said isolation had taken a toll on her husband — who was used to her coming in every night to get him ready for bed — but that he seemed to be more at ease now, even giving her a hug during a recent shift.
“He came up from behind me and put his arms around the front of me … which is an incredible feeling,” she told CNN. “So, he knows who I am. There’s no question, he knows who I am even in a mask.”"

Cuomo calls nationwide trend ‘concerning’",https://nypost.com/2020/07/12/ny-covid-19-stats-stay-low-but-gov-cuomo-calls-nationwide-trend-concerning/,2020-07-12 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
New York’s coronavirus statistics stayed stable this past week, with the five deaths reported Saturday tying last month’s record low — but Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned Sunday that the rest of the nation is still a threat to the state.
“Today’s numbers remain low and stable, but it is up to us to keep it that way,” the governor said in a statement.
“What’s happening elsewhere in the United States is very concerning to us here at home, and our ability to avoid the same fate rests on New Yorkers’ willingness to wear masks, socially distance and wash their hands, and local governments’ willingness to enforce state guidelines.”
He tweeted out the latest state figures, which have continued a trend he’s said is “in the right direction.”
There were 62,418 COVID 19 tests performed in New York on Saturday, with 677 coming back positive, or 1.08 percent — slightly higher than last Saturday’s figure of .84 percent but still in line with the recent numbers.
There also were 801 hospitalizations, a small jump over the week’s low of 799 Friday but below the 832 seven days ago.
In addition, the state reported five deaths from the coronavirus Saturday, the fewest for the week, including seven days ago when the figure hit eight — and tying June 28’s record low since the pandemic began.
But other states — including Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and Georgia — have been battling a jump in their number of cases and deaths from the virus — and New York officials fear that a local resurgence may only be a matter of time.
On Saturday, statistics showed that more than 134,600 people in the US have now died of the virus, a number that has increased over the past two weeks.
Cuomo noted in his statement Sunday concerns over three people from upstate Troy  who were on a recent Delta flight to Albany from Georgia and tested positive for the virus Friday.
“New York State is closely monitoring an uptick in COVID-19 cases in Rensselaer County, a number of which are being investigated as being linked to several individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 after traveling back to New York from Georgia,” the governor said. “They are in isolation and the New York State Department of Health and Rensselaer County Health Department are conducting contact tracing.”"

That’s one ape-sized nasal swab.
A gorilla in Miami was tested for the coronavirus after he developed a low-grade fever, according to his zoo.
Shango, a 31-year-old lowland gorilla, received the tests — which came back negative — while getting medical treatment for a bite wound, according to Zoo Miami.
The 433-pound animal was injured by his 26-year-old brother, Barney, when the gorillas tussled in a fight, zoo officials said.
He was taken Wednesday to an animal hospital, where he received X-rays, vaccines, ultrasound and other tests, the zoo said.
Though his bite wounds appear “quite deep,” there was no indication that there would be permanent damage, officials said.
He has since been returned to the gorilla area where he will be closely monitored as he continues to recover.
No decision has been made about when Shango will be reintroduced to his younger brother, the zoo said.
Shango and Barney were both born at the San Francisco Zoo and arrived at Zoo Miami in May of 2017.
The zoo said that scuffles between adult male gorillas are not uncommon, but most consists of a lot of posturing and rarely result in serious injuries."

An unmarried Queens dad whose kids were allegedly whisked off to California by their mom against his wishes says New York’s virus-shuttered Family Court has failed him.
“I want to be heard,” said Juan Miranda, 32, who says he hasn’t seen his two sons since mid-June, after their mom abruptly bolted Astoria, relocating to California in search of work.
Closures from coronavirus have wreaked havoc in courts across the city and state, including in Family Court, which deals with domestic disputes and child custody issues.
If Miranda and his former high school sweetheart had been married and divorced, the dad could have brought his case to state Supreme Court, which started taking new cases on May 25.
But the couple never got hitched, leaving Family Court — which has yet to begin hearing new cases, even as the rest of the court system slowly comes back to life — as the only place for Miranda to turn when his ex left with the kids, said his lawyer, Steven Gilden.
Miranda sued the city and state in Queens Supreme Court in a bid to have new cases like his heard.
In his July 7 court papers, he slammed Family Court’s refusal to take on fresh complaints as “rampant institutional discrimination against parents who simpl[y] just happen not to be married to each other.”
“It doesn’t make any sense,” said Gilden. “They chose to open a court for these cases where not everybody can go.”
A court spokesman confirmed Family Court is only dealing with pending or already filed cases, and declined comment on the litigation.
Miranda, a line cook at a Manhattan restaurant, had seen his sons, Damian, 15, and Allen, 11, two days a week since 2017 and had them full time for six weeks in April and May while their mom battled COVID-19 symptoms, he said.
“I would teach them how to cook,” he said. “We would make scrambled eggs. We made burgers and meatballs and spaghetti from scratch. During the six weeks they were here their grades went up dramatically.”
Their mom allegedly ignored his pleas not to take the boys, with whom he texts daily, said Miranda. He says the two are now staying in a cramped Airbnb.
“I can’t eat, sleep. I’m just thinking about my kids,” he said.
The mom could not be reached for comment."

Ross, 82, was not feeling well and decided to admit himself to a hospital, sources told Fox News.
A Commerce Department spokesperson on Saturday confirmed the hospitalization to the station but did not elaborate on his illness.
“Secretary Ross has been admitted into the hospital for minor, non-coronavirus related issues,” the spokesperson said.
“He is doing well and we anticipate his release soon.”
Ross is currently overseeing the 2020 United States Census.
He controversially approved a measure to add a question to the Census asking about citizenship status — a question that was eventually excluded from the survey after the Supreme Court decided it violated federal law."
458,Jean-Gabriel Pageau starting to mesh with Islanders teammates,https://nypost.com/2020/07/19/jean-gabriel-pageau-starting-to-mesh-with-islanders-teammates/,2020-07-19 00:00:00,"The novel coronavirus pandemic turned everyone’s life upside down. For Jean-Gabriel Pageau, it created havoc.
He was already going through a new transition, playing for a new team in a new country after being traded to the Islanders in February. Then hockey stopped due to the virus.
“It was definitely a different feeling how it all happened,” he said during a Zoom call on Saturday. “It happened so quick.”
There was one bonus it has provided: a chance to really get to know his teammates and the system the Islanders play during this mini training camp. There really wasn’t time for that in the seven games he played upon coming over from the Senators and signing a six-year, $30 million extension with the Islanders.
“It’s a huge benefit for sure. It gets me time to spend with the guys. I get to know them a little more. Get to practice more, too, with the team,” the 27-year-old Pageau, acquired in exchange for conditional first-round pick in 2020, a second-round pick in 2020 and a conditional third-rounder in 2022, said. “That’s something that during the year you don’t usually have a lot of time for. It really helps me.”
It’s only been practice and a few scrimmages, but Pageau’s teammates and coach Barry Trotz have liked what they have seen since the team returned to the ice together. Pageau provides them with a quality third line pivot, a center that offers depth and enables Derick Brassard and Josh Bailey to go back to where Troz feels they fit better. The Isles had been forced to mix and match at center before landing Pageau.
“You can see he’s more natural there,” Trotz said. “I thought [Saturday] Pag looked much more comfortable. He’s starting to look way more comfortable.”
At the time of the trade, he was having a career year, producing a career-best 24 goals and 16 assists. In seven games with the Isles, he had scored twice, without notching an assist. Now, after this long layoff, he may be better prepared to make a difference. 
“Anybody who got traded at the deadline for any team in this tournament, I think they’re going to benefit from it,” Trotz said. “I don’t think you’re yourself until you have a number of games and a training camp. I think this is the best thing, not only for Pag, but anybody who got traded during the deadline.”"
459,"Virus deaths top 600,000 as cases rise in South Africa, Australia",https://nypost.com/2020/07/19/virus-deaths-top-600000-as-cases-rise-in-south-africa-australia/,2020-07-19 00:00:00,"JOHANNESBURG — Countries from the U.S. to South Africa to Australia were struggling to hold down rising rates of the coronavirus, as global deaths from COVID-19 surged past 600,000 in a sign of how far off the world remains from a return to normalcy.
While the U.S. leads global infections, South Africa now ranks as the fifth worst-hit country in the pandemic with 350,879 cases — roughly half of all those confirmed on the African continent. Its struggles are a sign of trouble to come for nations with even fewer health care resources.
China confirmed 13 new cases in the northwestern city of Urumqi on Sunday, while South Korea reported less than 40 additional cases for a second straight day.
The Urumqi outbreak is the latest to pop up since China largely contained the domestic spread of the virus in March. At least 30 people have been infected and authorities are conducting universal testing in communities where cases were discovered, later to be expanded to other parts of the city and major businesses.
South Korean authorities are also struggling to suppress an uptick in local infections, with 34 additional cases, 21 of them domestic and 13 from overseas, raising the country’s total to 13,745 with 295 deaths.
Both countries are mandating testing and enforcing two-week quarantines on all overseas arrivals.
After a one-day respite, COVID-19 cases in the Australian state of Victoria rose again, prompting a move to make masks mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne and the nearby shire of Mitchell. Health officials on Sunday recorded 363 new cases in the past 24 hours. Two men and a woman in their 90s died, taking the national death toll from COVID-19 to 122.
The World Health Organization on Saturday again reported a single-day record of new infections with 259,848.
South Africa now trails the U.S., Brazil, India — all far more populous countries — in the number of infections, surpassing Peru, after health authorities announced 13,285 new cases.
South Africa’s new coronavirus epicenter, Gauteng province, hosts the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria and one-quarter of the country’s population of 57 million, with many poor people living in crowded conditions in the middle of a frosty Southern Hemisphere winter.
“The simple fact is that many South Africans are sitting ducks because they cannot comply with World Health Organization protocols on improved hygiene and social distancing,” the foundation of former South African archbishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu and his wife, Leah, warned in a statement.
Global COVID-19 deaths have hit 601,549, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The United States tops the list with 140,119 deaths, followed by 78,772 in Brazil and 45,358 in the United Kingdom and 38,888 in Mexico, where a surge in cases have frustrated plans to reopen the economy.
The number of confirmed infections worldwide has passed 14.2 million, out of which 3.7 million are in the United States. There are over 2 million in Brazil and more than 1 million in India. Experts believe the true numbers around the world are higher because of testing shortages and data collection issues in some nations.
Infections are soaring in U.S. states like Florida, Texas, Arizona, fueled by the haphazard lifting of lockdowns and the resistance of some Americans to wearing masks.
Teams of military medics have been deployed in Texas and California to help hospitals deal with a deluge of patients who are flooding emergency rooms in parts of the U.S. Some patients are being moved into hallways to make room for most seriously ill and nurses are working extra shifts to keep up with the surge.
Patients struggling to breathe are being placed on ventilators in emergency wards since intensive care units are full, officials say.
Patients are waiting “hours and hours” to get admitted, said Dr. Alison Haddock of the Baylor College of Medicine in the state of Texas, which reported a new daily record for virus deaths Friday and more than 10,000 confirmed cases for the fourth consecutive day. More than 80 infants have tested positive for the virus in the state.
“I’ve never seen anything like this COVID surge,” said Haddock, who has worked in emergency rooms since 2007. “We’re doing our best, but we’re not an ICU.”
The surge of infections means that millions of American children are unlikely to return to classrooms full time in the fall.
Police in Barcelona are limiting access to some of the city’s beaches because sunbathers are ignoring regulations amid a resurgence of the coronavirus. Authorities in Amsterdam are urging people not to visit the city’s famous red-light district and have closed off some of the historic district’s narrow streets because they are too busy.
Local governments in India continued to reimpose focused lockdowns in several parts of the country following a surge in cases. And in Iran, the president made the startling announcement that as many as 25 million Iranians could have been infected, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Hassan Rouhani cited a new Health Ministry study that has not been made public. Iran has the Middle East’s worst outbreak with more than 270,000 confirmed cases.
In Bangladesh, confirmed cases surpassed 200,000 but experts say the number is much higher as the country lacks adequate labs for testing. Most people in rural areas have stopped wearing masks and are thronging shopping centers ahead of the Islamic festival Eid al-Adha this month.
Scientists, meanwhile, poured cold water on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s hope that the country may return to normal by Christmas, saying that, without a vaccine, normal life was a long way off."
460,Florida man fights for his life after son infects family with COVID-19,https://nypost.com/2020/07/19/florida-dad-fights-for-his-life-after-son-infects-family-with-coronavirus/,2020-07-19 00:00:00,"A Florida dad is fighting for his life with COVID-19 after his 21-year-old son went out with friends and brought home the virus, the family said.
John Place, 42, of Plantation, was placed on a ventilator after the virus spread throughout their household, his wife, Michelle Zymet, said in a Facebook Live video.
Zymet said her 21-year-old stepson had gone out with friends against their wishes then removed his mask while eating and drinking with friends.
“They don’t necessarily listen. It could be peer pressure,” said Zymet, 42. “Maybe they think, ‘None of us are sick. We are fine.’ They don’t understand many of us are asymptomatic and are positive carriers of the virus.”
Days later, he began to feel sick with symptoms of the virus and learned a friend who was at the outing had tested positive for the virus.
Soon, the rest of the family had become sick with the virus, starting with his 14-year-old brother, who is overweight and was wheezing, coughing and lethargic.
His 6-year-old sister had a runny nose, while Zymet was achy, with a fever and chills.
The whole family tested positive for the virus, but only Place, the father, landed in the hospital’s intensive care unit, where he was on a ventilator for more than two weeks.
Place, who Zymet said is diabetic, has since been removed from the ventilator and his health has improved slightly.
Zymet said she’s sharing the family’s story as a warning because the younger generation won’t understand the risks of the pandemic “until it hits home.”
“We could have eventually gotten this disease somewhere else,” she said. “But it is the unfortunate truth that he did bring it home.”

The city’s coronavirus tracing program will start asking people if they’ve been at outdoor bars and restaurants to help understand the spike in cases among those between the ages of 20 and 29 — even though health officials never asked if people attended the George Floyd protests, The Post has learned.
“Patients are asked who they spent close time with socially. To ensure we’re adapting our program to New Yorkers’ changing routes, patients will explicitly be asked if they spent time with their close contact at a bar or restaurant as the city continues to reopen,” said City Hall spokeswoman Avery Cohen said, while reaffirming they won’t be asked about demonstrations.
“People are asked to name any gatherings they have attended to help identify cases related to specific events,” Cohen said. “Regarding bars and restaurants, we’re adapting the program to match the increased mobility of New Yorkers, especially those in the younger age brackets.”
The city’s Dept. of Health found that the proportion of 20-somethings diagnosed with COVID-19 doubled during the second half of June. The new cases were less likely to live in the Bronx and more likely to reside in wealthier neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan including the Financial District and Greenwich Village, according to lab reports.
“We didn’t see an uptick from the protests. They reached their peak over a month ago at this point,” Cohen said when asked why the tracing corps wasn’t tracking protest attendance.
Earlier in the week Dr. Jay Varma, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s senior adviser for public health, said, “There’s nothing that we can see that directly links the protests to the rise that we’re seeing right now among younger people.”
But, he admitted, “There’s a lot we don’t know.”
Dr. S. Patrick Kachur, a professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, defended the city’s position about leaving demonstrations out of tracing questions.
“Asking about protests might alienate some people — and it might not generate that much useful information.
“What would you do if knew someone was standing out in the Barclay’s Center for hours? Would you ask literally everybody to come in? So, they took some reasonable steps – trying to ascertain this information could compromise our ability to establish the trust that we need,” Kachur explained.
But a former associate commissioner for the federal Food and Drug Administration slammed the approach.
“When President Trump says if we stop testing we’ll have fewer cases, the Mayor calls out the hypocrisy,” Peter Pitts said.
“When we can’t explain the uptick in our fair city’s COVID-19 infection rates among the 20-29 age group — and we aren’t asking if they’ve attended a Black Lives Matter protest, that’s called hypocrisy too. Wake up, Your honor. Closing your eyes and covering your ears won’t change the facts,” Pitts said.
Dr. Jake Deutsch, co-founder of Cure Urgent Care that’s tested over 5,000 patients for COVID-19, agreed that the tracing corps should ask about protests.
“The purpose of contact tracing is you’re trying to identify sources of where the infections are occurring, so I think you ask about gatherings whether it’s bars, protests, schools, churches. The question shouldn’t just stop with, ‘Were you in a restaurant?’ You’d have to be much inclusive. And trying to predict that [bars are] the source of the problem I think that’s a pretty impossible presumption given the fact that it’s a highly contagious virus,” Deutsch said.
He believes the higher proportion of twenty-somethings testing positive for COVID-19 is due to increased testing for all New Yorkers — not just the elderly and vulnerable.
“I’ve seen more young people be tested than we’d seen for months ago for instance so I think you’re going to see a spike when you see more testing,” Deutsch said."

In a seemingly coordinated social media effort, Patrick Mahomes, Drew Brees, JJ Watt, Russell Wilson, Todd Gurley and others each shared posts within minutes — and sometimes seconds — of each other, highlighting player health and safety concerns regarding the pandemic, while noting the possibility that the season could be postponed or cancelled if the league doesn’t meet the union’s demands. Players closed their respective posts with “#WeWantToPlay.”
“Getting ready to report this week hoping the @NFL will come to agreement with the safe and right protocols so we can feel protected playing the sport we love #WeWantToPlay,” Mahomes wrote on Twitter.
Watt tackled many of the issues on Twitter:
-“We still have not been granted the full and proper training camp acclimation period necessary as recommended by the medical and training staffs.”
-“We still do not know if there will be daily testing, every other day testing, etc.”
-“We still do not know how a positive Covid test will be handled in regards to others in close contact (in the huddle, directly engaged with, etc.)”
-“A strong and fair opt-out clause for those at higher risk or those with family members as higher risk has still not been agreed upon.”
-“If players do not show up on time, they can be fined or considered in breach of contract, even if health and safety protocols have not been agreed upon or IDER (Infectious Disease Emergency Response) plans have been approved.”
NFL Network reported the joint medical committee recommended a 21-day “acclimation period” to gradually ramp up activity, and that the NFL wanted players to arrive two weeks early under that scenario. The NFLPA said no to that, and also wants zero preseason games while the league wants two.
Brees blasted the league’s refusal to adopt COVID-19 safety guidelines set by doctors.
“We need Football! We need sports! We need hope! The NFL’s unwillingness to follow the recommendations of their own medical experts will prevent that” Brees wrote. “If the NFL doesn’t do their part to keep players healthy there is no football in 2020. It’s that simple.”
Gurley, and others, echoed the sentiment in an effort to gain the public’s support.
“You want to watch football this year?” Gurley wrote. “Us players need to remain healthy in order to make that happen. The @NFL needs to do their part in order to bring football back safely in 2020.”
Currently, no protocol is in place to shut down a team facility due to COVID-19 exposure or what amount of spread would force a team to quarantine.
Wilson’s fear stretches beyond the field and locker room.
“I am concerned. My wife is pregnant,” Wilson said of his wife Ciara, who is expecting a baby boy with the Seahawks quarterback. “@NFL training camp is about to start. And there’s still no clear plan on player health and family safety….We want to play foootball but we also want to protect our loved ones.”
Chiefs and Texans rookies are scheduled to report for training camp on Monday."

Lawyers for the convicted 76-year-old ex-Assembly speaker tried to convince a federal judge last week to allow him to appear by video feed for his sentencing because of the coronavirus, but the jurist balked.
“The Courthouse has reopened to the public and implemented screening at entry, mask and social-distancing requirements, and sanitation protocols, among other precautions,” federal Judge Valerie Caproni wrote in her ruling.
“This Court is currently holding in-person proceedings where those measures are all observed. Accordingly, it is the Court’s preference to conduct Mr. Silver’s re-sentencing at the Courthouse.”
The shamed elderly con refused to comment to The Post on Sunday as he hopped in his car dressed in a blue polo shirt and wearing a mask outside his Grand Street home in Lower Manhattan.
Silver was convicted in 2015 of misusing his powerful position to rake in bribes and sentenced to seven years behind bars. He remained free on appeal, and the verdict was tossed on a technicality.
He was then retried in 2018 and convicted again. He appealed and won somewhat, with a few of the counts tossed. But he still faces sentencing on the remaining counts.
Prosecutors have said Silver still deserves the seven-year sentence, while he says he should not be serve any time in prison, given his age and the health risks associated with COVID-19."

With city jiggle joints still prohibited from opening due to the coronavirus pandemic, one woman took matters into her own hands during a massive parking lot party in Manhattan’s Inwood neighborhood.
Video posted on Twitter shows the unnamed woman dancing topless in front of a huge crowd in the Speedway gas station parking lot on West 207th Street.
In the clip, the woman is wearing panties and nothing else while the mostly male crowd bobs along.
“dyckman be different,” user @KIILOLOO posted along with the video, in reference to nearby Dyckman Street.
In the clip, the unidentified tail-shaker can be seen scooping up what appears to be cash off the street.
It’s not clear when the video was shot. None of the onlookers are wearing masks.
New York strip clubs outside of the city have been allowed to re-open as part of the fourth phase of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s staggered reopening of the state’s economy.
New York City has yet to reach Phase 4 — thought the state is not likely to let city strip clubs and other other indoor establishments reopen when it does."

A Kentucky couple says they were placed under house arrest and fitted with ankle bracelets after they refused to sign a self-quarantine order over a positive coronavirus test.
Elizabeth Linscott of Radcliff said she got tested for COVID-19 as a precaution because she was planning to visit her family in Michigan, news station WAVE reported.
The next day, she received a positive along with an email from the health department containing a form to sign, the News-Enterprise reported.
The document asked that she check in daily with her symptoms, self-isolate and let officials know if she has to seek hospital treatment.
But Linscott said she opted not to sign because she worried about whether she would have time to contact health officials in the event of a health emergency.
“My part was if I have to go to the ER, if I have to go to the hospital, I’m not going to wait to get the approval to go,” Linscott told WAVE.
But on Thursday, Linscott’s husband, Isaiah, was greeted by local authorities at the front door of their home.
“I open up the door and there’s like eight different people,” he said. “I’m like what the heck’s going on?”
“This guy’s in a suit with a mask, it’s the health department guy and he has three different papers for us. For me, her and my daughter.”
The couple was placed under house arrest for two weeks and ordered to wear ankle monitors that will notify law enforcement if they travel more than 200 feet from the property, the reports said.
“We didn’t rob a store. We didn’t steal something,” Elizabeth said. “We didn’t hit and run. We didn’t do anything wrong.”
Lincoln Trail District Health Department declined to comment on the matter, citing the privacy of the family."
466,Jack Nicklaus reveals he and his wife had coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/07/19/memorial-jack-nicklaus-reveals-he-and-his-wife-had-coronavirus/,2020-07-19 00:00:00,"DUBLIN, Ohio — Jack Nicklaus and his wife, Barbara, both contracted coronavirus in March and since have tested negative for the virus and positive for the antibodies.
The 80-year-old Nicklaus, founder and host of the Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village Golf Club, revealed the stunning news during the CBS telecast of Sunday’s final round.
Nicklaus said he and his wife self-isolated at home in south Florida from March 13 to April 20.
“Barbara was asymptomatic, and I had a sore throat and a cough,’’ Nicklaus told Jim Nantz. “It didn’t last very long, and we were very, very fortunate, very lucky. Barbara and I are both of the age that is an at-risk age.
“Our hearts go out to the people who did lose their lives and their families. We were just a couple of the lucky ones, so we feel very strong about working with those who are taking care of those who have COVID-19.”
When he was asked earlier in the week about his long-standing tradition of shaking the Memorial winner’s hand on the 18th green at the end of the tournament, he said, “I’m going to shake their hand. I’m going to walk right out there and shake [their] hand. If they don’t want to shake my hand, that’s fine, I’ll give them a fist bump or an elbow bump.
“But I’m not going to give them COVID-19. I wouldn’t put anybody in that position. And, if I was in any danger of doing that, I wouldn’t shake their hand. Incidentally, I like shaking their hand, too. I think that’s a great tradition, but it was as much fun for me as I hope it is for them.’’
On Sunday, Nicklaus clarified his comments.
“[Reporters] asked me if I was going to shake hands on the 18th green with the winner,’’ he said. “Well, if the winner wants to shake hands, that’s fine, [but] I won’t put him in the position.”
Nicklaus, who holds the all-time record with 18 major championship victories, revealed that he tested positive on March 13, the same day the PGA Tour canceled the Players Championship and paused its schedule.
“We were home from the 13th of March and we were done with it by about the 20th of April,” he said. “We stayed at home for the next month to make sure we were well.”
After he completed his final round Sunday, Tiger Woods, who lives near Nicklaus in the Palm Beach, Fla., area, said he knew Nicklaus and his wife had contracted the virus.
“The fact that they got through it and they’re safe and here and healthy, it’s all good news for all of us who are a part of golf and who looked up to Jack and been around Barbara all these years,” Woods said. “The fact that they’re healthy is nothing but positives.”"
467,NFL can’t ignore players’ coronavirus pleas any longer,https://nypost.com/2020/07/19/nfl-cant-ignore-players-coronavirus-pleas-any-longer/,2020-07-19 00:00:00,"There has always been a pool of players willing to risk life and limb available to the NFL, from elite players to semipro players chasing a dream.
The money is good, in some cases obscenely good, and combined with the love of the game, it makes for a most seductive siren call for the legions of players hungering for a fix for their addiction.
For a long time, certainly until head trauma injuries became a growing concern in the past decade, safety was not at the forefront of NFL priorities the way it should have been. For legal and sensible reasons, it has moved to address those concerns … too late, unfortunately, for Steelers Hall of Famer Mike Webster (CTE), too late for Dave Duerson and Junior Seau, who committed suicide, too late for a linebacker named Chris Borland, who retired five years ago at age 24.
But here we are in the grip of a raging pandemic that has continued to confound the best and brightest health and science minds, and with the death toll around 140,000 in this country alone and counting, a sport all too appealing to a highly contagious virus, and prominent players on Sunday deciding to issue a social media plea to the owners:
We Want To Play But We Want To Be Safe.
In other words: Better safe than sorry.
Is this a negotiating tactic?
Or does it signal a lack of trust between the players and owners?
It is both.
That it comes at a time when players are scheduled to begin reporting for training camp by July 28 … when Chiefs and Texans rookies are due to report on Monday …
Is this predictable brinkmanship?
Or is it a worrisome development that could complicate, if not delay and endanger, the NFL season #WeWantToWatch?
It is both.
Stop the Madness!
From Patrick Mahomes to Drew Brees to Myles Garrett to Carson Wentz to Jarvis Landry to Demarcus Lawrence to so many others came a Twitter blitz that decried the NFL’s COVID-19 protocols as ranging from unsatisfactory to dangerous.
Lawrence: “How has the @NFL had this long to prep but still have NO real plan in place? We are less than 10 days before we are REQUIRED to report! I refuse to put my pregnant wife/family at risk w/o understanding exactly what the plan for our safety & well being will be.”
Of course the NFL has a real plan.
It is an elaborate plan.
But a big part of the problem is that the league, for whatever reason, has not effectively communicated that plan to the players.
There is no vaccine. Only educated guesses about who might be vulnerable and at risk.
It is more of a life-and-death issue for football than it is in any other sport.
Of course the NFL does have protocol safeguards in place. It would be malpractice if the league did not, and the league knows it better than anyone.
But the players still have legitimate concerns the league should address, and NOW.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell listened to the players when they made that compelling Black Lives Matter video following the death of George Floyd while in police custody, and now players — black and white — are reminding him that their lives matter playing a 60-minute collision sport that requires blocking and tackling and huddling.
Stefon Diggs: “If #AdamSilver can respect the voices and protect his @NBA players why can’t @nflcommish do the same? Listen to your players. If we want to have a full season it will have to look different with OUR safety as the priority. @NFL make the necessary changes.”
The NFL, even with its contact tracing implementation, even with tracking devices on players, should bend on its plan to test players three times a week and agree to daily testing.
And the league should scrap the preseason games.
The risk is not worth the reward.
I’ll let the two sides work to reach agreement on the remaining issues — the opt-out clause and acclimation period among them — and the economics.
No one wants this to be a repeat of the ugly feud between MLB owners and players that was resolved with a 60-game season.
Anything but that.
NFL: Don’t do this to yourself. Don’t do this to us. Don’t play with our emotions. You want to play. You all agree on that.
#WeWantToWatch."
468,NYC’s Phase Four of reopening feels similar to Phase Three,https://nypost.com/2020/07/19/new-york-city-started-phase-four-of-reopening-monday/,2020-07-19 00:00:00,"New York City on Monday started Phase Four of the state’s reopening plan amid the coronavirus — although with plenty of caveats.
Big Apple residents are now allowed to go to such destinations as zoos and botanical gardens, and baseball teams can start playing again, although sans fans. Outdoor film productions can resume, too.
Indoor restaurant dining, museum visits and mall shopping — which were all initially set to be permitted under the final phase of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s program — are still no-gos for the city.
Cuomo has cited contagion upticks elsewhere in the country, as well as city scofflaws congregating too closely together and without masks outside bars and restaurants, as reasons for holding the Apple back from completely reopening.
The latest reported contagion figures show the state and city are continuing to remain stabilized in terms of hospitalizations, deaths and the rate of infection among those tested.
Said Cuomo in a Sunday statement, “I know it’s tempting to be tired of the many rules and guidelines the state has issued, but I reiterate that this pandemic is far from over.’’
There have been 25,048 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in the state so far, including 13 reported Saturday, although those figures don’t include suspected fatalities.
By the city’s count, which includes “probable’’ fatal cases, the Big Apple has lost 23,400 people.
Among the businesses allowed to reopen while adhering to strict social-distancing and capacity guidelines are retail stores, real-estate businesses and personal-care facilities such as nail salons.
Gyms, movie theaters and Broadway theaters are among the sites still closed in the city.
“This is what we said from Day 1,” the governor said Friday.
“Reopen smart, and if you reopen smart, and you reopen in phases, and you follow the data, it’s actually a better way for the economy to reopen because if you rush the reopening then you risk the probability of a viral increase.”
Outdoor dining is already allowed, but it has drawn heavy criticism because of the crowds it has created, including involving many people without masks.
Also of concern have been packed street protests after the police-brutality death of George Floyd.
A viral surge in other parts of the country — from Florida to Texas to California — has the state on edge, too.
“I want all New Yorkers to be on high alert — the virus is spreading,’’ Cuomo added Friday. “It’s all across the country. It’s getting worse, and it will have an effect on New York.”"

Prime Minister Dr. Hubert Minnis cited recent spikes in COVID-19 cases as the reason for the restrictions, which he announced on Sunday — three weeks after the Caribbean country largely reopened to international travel, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported.
“Regrettably, the situation here at home has already deteriorated since we began the reopening of our domestic economy,” Minnis said.
“It has deteriorated at an exponential rate since we reopened our international borders.”
All air and sea travel — to and from the neighboring US — will be shut off as of Wednesday at midnight, he said.
Any Americans still on the islands will be allowed to leave after that date under special accommodations.
Tourists from Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union will still be allowed — as long as they provide proof they tested negative for the virus at least 10 days ahead of their arrival.
The island nation of about 390,000 recorded 15 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, bringing its total to 153, according to the Bahamian Ministry of Health. Eleven people have died of the virus in the Bahamas."

Kimora “Kimmie” Lynum died in her sleep at her Gainesville home on the night of July 17, relatives told WTLV.
“She was a happy child, but she didn’t even get to live her life,” cousin Dejeon Cain told the outlet.
Family members said the girl did not have any underlying health conditions when she came down with a raging fever.
“She was doing good at one point, and all of a sudden she had a situation with a fever,” Cain said.
The girl’s mother took her to the hospital for treatment, but she was sent home, relatives said. She collapsed a short time later and died after her heart failed.
Local health officials confirmed the child’s death, with records showing her case was not travel-related, according to WCJB. The state does not report pre-existing conditions.
The family said they don’t know how Kimmie caught COVID-19, saying she had stayed home all summer and hadn’t been in contact with anyone known to have the virus.
She was her mother’s only child. Her father, Theophilus Lynum, was shot and killed in April, Cain said.
“This is like a double whammy…,” Cain told WGFL. “We just buried him and now we’re burying her. The family is troubled.”
After her dad’s death, Kimmie “still was joyous and had that grace on her,” Cain said.
“She was an incredible kid.”
They family has set up a GoFundMe to help pay for funeral arrangements.
Kimmie is the fifth minor to die of COVID-19 in the Sunshine State, where at least 5,853 people have succumbed to the virus.
As of Sunday evening, Florida had at least 423,855 recorded cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."
471,Hedge-funder gambles on coronavirus to build casino empire,https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/hedge-funder-gambles-on-coronavirus-to-build-casino-empire/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The hedge-fund honcho once dubbed Dov Charney’s “moneyman” is now betting he can build a casino empire with a little help from the coronavirus, The Post has learned.
Soo Kim, co-founder of hedge-fund giant Standard General, has already scooped up three casinos on the cheap since the pandemic struck in March, including Bally’s Atlantic City Hotel & Casino — which he bought for $25 million, the price of some New York City metro-area homes.
But Kim, a 45-year-old Queens native, sees more such opportunities opening up as the pandemic drags on, squeezing gambling houses loaded down with debt.
“A lot of casino companies, due to their balance sheets going up too high, are in tough shape now and are not prepared to take advantage of this regional opportunity,” the Stuyvesant HS graduate told The Post.
“We are one of the few that have scale and a good balance sheet,” he said of Twin River Worldwide Holdings, an operator of no-frills gambling houses that is 38 percent owned by Standard General.
Twin River, based in Lincoln, RI, now owns 10 gambling properties across six states, as well as a horse racetrack with 13 authorized off-track betting licenses in Colorado.
It acquired three of those properties in April as casino giants Caesars Entertainment and Eldorado Resorts scrambled to sell assets to close on a planned $17 billion merger.
In addition to buying Bally’s — a 1,251-room hotel and casino on the Atlantic City Boardwalk — from Caesars, Twin River also scooped up Eldorado’s namesake property in Shreveport, La., and its Montbleu in Lake Tahoe, Nev., for $155 million.
Twin River paid just 3.6 times earnings for the three venues, or roughly the cost of the real estate, Kim says.
“The price we offered was really low,” he said. “Even if these casinos are closed for two years, it’s a good deal.”
While Caesars and Eldorado sold to win regulatory approval for their merger, the coronavirus also played a role, experts said, noting that the Shreveport property was on track to fetch as much as $230 million in January before the deal fell through.
Kim made headlines in 2014 for partnering with American Apparel’s controversial founder and CEO, Charney, after Charney had been ousted for alleged sexual harassment. Efforts to revive the retailer failed, however, and it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2015.
Among Standard General’s more successful turnaround efforts is Turning Point Brands, licensor of Zig-Zag tobacco wrapping paper. Standard General bought it in 2010, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The stock closed on Friday at $29.67 a share.
Kim is hoping for a similar success story with Twin River, known for its focus on regional, no-frills casinos — a sector that has been doing well of late because they attract heavy gamblers instead of families and conferencegoers, analysts said.
When Standard General first got involved with its Twin River stake in 2016, it was generating $50 million in annual earnings. That’s now projected to grow to $200 million. As Twin River’s chairman, Kim is aiming for earnings of $500 million a year, he said.
With the exception of Bally’s, all of Twin River’s casinos are in the green since reopening in May, Kim said.
“It’s amazing how behavior bounces back,” Kim said. “I think spending has been a little better [at the casinos] than for discretionary purchases. People enjoy gambling.”"
472,"Domestic violence soared during coronavirus in NYC, experts say",https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/domestic-violence-soared-during-coronavirus-in-nyc-report-shows/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
At the height of New York’s coronavirus lockdown, domestic violence in the five boroughs skyrocketed, data show.
When the pandemic first laid siege, experts predicted that mandatory lockdowns and soaring unemployment would cause a rise in household abuse, and figures now bear them out — with domestic-violence reports at some agencies doubling and even tripling in the past few months.
“We’ve never been busier,’’ lamented Nechama Bakst, senior director of the Met Council’s family-violence program.
“We have seen people who never experienced violence starting to experience violence, and people who have experienced violence experience worse violence.’’
Typically, the non-profit gets about 70 new cases a month — but in April, they juggled 135, another 145 in May and 146 more in June, the organization said.
“We see more choking, more sexual violence, kind of much more intense and serious acts of crime,’’ the director said.
At Sanctuary for Families, which also works with survivors, there was a similar increase in calls to its helpline.
In May, the group received 206 calls, compared to 102 for the month the year before. In June, calls more than tripled, with 259 compared to 73 last year.
“Domestic violence is fundamentally about power and control,” said Dorchen Leidholdt, director of SFF’s Legal Center. “The coronavirus pandemic gave abusers a powerful tool of control because their victims were in much closer proximity to them, 24/7 in many cases, and had less access to sources of support and assistance.’’
In many cases, the pandemic became just one more tool in a perpetrator’s arsenal, experts said.
Some abusers would withhold personal protective equipment from their victims so it wouldn’t be safe to leave home. In other cases, if an abuser ended up catching the coronavirus, they would shame and blame their partner for it or become physically violent, advocates said.
Some would also refuse to social distance or wash their hands — and then “taunt” their victims about it in a way that made them “feel unsafe,” Bakst said.
One abuser warned a victim, “You better watch your back … because the courts are closed, so you can’t do anything,” said SFF — which helped the person in need get an order of protection.
High unemployment brought on by the virus only compounded the situation because abusers are more physically violent — and likely to kill — when they’re out of work, experts said.
“It was a twin tsunami,’’ Leidholdt said. “On the one hand, abusers were unemployed, angry and more abusive than ever with more access to their victims than ever. … And then victims were more economically dependent than ever before.’’
Amid the lockdowns, the abused were trapped inside with their perpetrators all day, forcing some to hide in their bathrooms in the dead of night so they could whisper frantic pleas for help into their phones as their abusers slept, said David Greenfield, the Met Council’s CEO.
In response, both the SFF and Met Council created a text-based helpline for victims, which was a much safer way to communicate.
The experts noted that the most dangerous moment for a victim is when they’re trying to leave their abuser, which is why most escapes are carried out when the attackers are out of the house.
With coronavirus stay-at-home orders in place, fleeing became more difficult and thus more dangerous — making “situations that are already bad … exponentially worse,” Greenfield told The Post.
In one case, a woman and her children were in a “highly, highly dangerous” situation with an abuser who kept weapons in the home, Bakst said.
The torment against the victims escalated amid the pandemic, and the woman asked the Met Council for help getting her and her kids out.
“We figured out a time of day, it was literally 15 minutes that she had where she was not being watched,” Bakst recalled.
“And in those 15 minutes, we coordinated a way to get her to a place where she can get out and get to safety.”
Still, for many victims, reaching out is never easy — and became even harder amid the pandemic, advocates said.
There was one woman who said she was too scared to call 911 because she was concerned police officers would give her coronavirus, Bakst said.
“Seeking help outside the home was more difficult than ever because the courts were operating virtually, there was a period when the NYPD was dealing with its own coronavirus crisis, and we did not see the same level of responsiveness when a survivor called 911,” Leidholdt added.
“The only way to get help is the telephone, and using a telephone when you’re in close quarters with an abuser [is nearly impossible].”
When victims did get a chance to call for help, they used “codes” devised with their case worker to discreetly communicate whether the offender was around.
“If someone starts giving us directions to the mall, that was code for, like, ‘I gotta go’ without saying ‘I gotta go, he’s here,’ ” Bakst explained.
“For some people it’s ‘I got to put dinner in the oven’ — and that means to the social worker, ‘FYI he’s here.’ ”
For abusers used to targeting vulnerable people, a global pandemic perfectly set the stage for increased exploitation, Leidholdt said.
“Abusers tend to be serial perpetrators. They seek out vulnerable victims and take advantage of victim’s vulnerability, and the coronavirus pandemic significantly increased the vulnerability of women and children in particular in New York City,” she said.
“It increased their vulnerability economically, it increased their vulnerability in terms of public health, it increased their vulnerability in what is a really very terrifying environment where venturing out unprotected can lead to illness and even death,” the advocate went on.
“Abusers take advantage of those kinds of situations, they use them, and they exploit them to increase their power and control over victims.”
At times, Leidholdt and her team found themselves “fairly overwhelmed by the need” of domestic violence survivors amid the pandemic, she said.
“Even though we had the help of eight large law firms, we got more calls and clients in need of assistance than in key moments we were able to assist,” Leidholdt recalled.
Ultimately, no one was turned away, but the nonprofit gets “many more referrals” than they have the capacity to assist, shining a light on the need for increased services for domestic violence victims, staff said.
The coronavirus pandemic has plunged the Big Apple billions of dollars into the red, and many programs for domestic violence survivors have been cut in the FY2021 budget, fiscal reports show. The cuts include programs that support survivors post-victimization and funding for various district attorney’s offices that allow for improved prosecution, even as crimes related to domestic violence such as murder, rape and assault have increased, reports show.
Funding for domestic violence programs under the Human Resources Administration was cut by nearly $1 million, the biggest decrease it has faced in years, reports show.
While Leidholdt said the cuts could’ve been a lot worse, funding wasn’t enough even before the pandemic.
“Certainly this isn’t new, but we see it more during the time of the coronavirus pandemic. There is a much greater need for legal services, for clinical services, for economic empowerment services and for shelter services than currently exists. For all of these services, there are wait lists,” Leidholdt said.
“The sad reality is, they are not remotely adequate.”

473,Marlins’ coronavirus crisis poses serious MLB dilemma: Sherman,https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/marlins-coronavirus-crisis-poses-serious-mlb-dilemma/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"MLB could not make it out of the first weekend of regular-season games before facing its most significant COVID-19 challenge.
The Marlins learned Saturday night that from tests administered Friday three players had tested positive for the virus, The Post has learned. An additional test was administered team-wide Sunday before a game against the Phillies in Philadelphia, with results due by early Monday.
Thus, the Marlins changed their plans from flying back to Miami after the game until Monday, when they are scheduled to play their home opener against the Orioles. The results will determine if other members of the Marlins traveling party have to stay quarantined in Philadelphia.
Marlins catcher Jorge Alfaro already was placed on the injured list Friday before the Miami-Philadelphia series began without a public reason given (players must give permission for teams to announce that they have tested positive or shown signs of COVID-19). Sunday’s scheduled Marlins starter Jose Urena was scratched and two position players also were not available. Earlier this month, Miami placed outfielders Lewis Brinson and Matt Joyce on the IL without further explanation.
After MLB and the Marlins learned of the positive tests, tracing was done to determine who those players had been in contact with and the other players were questioned about symptoms and it was decided to play Sunday’s game. Miguel Rojas, one of the Marlins’ team leaders, said all 30 Marlins met and “There was never a thought that we would not play.”
Marlins manager Don Mattingly said, “We never considered not playing [Sunday]. We are taking risks every day.”
The concern remains that players can be asymptomatic spreaders before tests reveal the virus. Plus, the potential contagion is not limited to just one team — the Phillies incurred greater risk Sunday, too — and the risk grows of infecting family.
“It’s fair to say that guys are concerned,” Mattingly said. “We are talking about health. We are talking about these guys traveling back to their families and kids and we want to be safe. They have a voice and we are going to listen.”
To try to weather lost players, MLB and the players association agreed to allow teams to have a 60-player pool from which to choose during the season (with the non-active players working out at a satellite site) and teams on the road taking a three-man taxi squad that must include a catcher. Mattingly mentioned that MLB should consider expanding the taxi squad so that teams in a scramble have more options at their disposal.
But what is the critical mass of absences that would move MLB to cancel a game — or more?
The sport is used to dealing with player loss. Since the season began Thursday, star pitchers Ken Giles, Clayton Kershaw, Corey Kluber, Stephen Strasburg and Justin Verlander were all reported injured. Perhaps that is normal. Perhaps it is a result of a second, but abbreviated training camp to ready for the shortened season. But pitching injuries, in particular, are familiar.
What the Marlins are enduring is unfamiliar. The same for the Reds, who had Matt Davidson show a positive test on Saturday, then on Sunday (without explanation) placed Mike Moustakas on the injured list and scratched Nick Senzel from the lineup. It is not revealed whether players tested positive or just showed symptoms and caution was being used.
MLB’s testing numbers have been promisingly low to date, but none has been released publicly since teams started traveling for regular-season games, which entails — among other things — flights and hotels. It also means a team from a current COVID-19 epicenter such as Miami will travel to other cities and host games in its city with virus numbers in south Florida soaring. A major reason Canada refused to allow the Blue Jays to play their home games in Toronto was because of concerns about teams from hot spots traveling into the country. Pennsylvania forbade the Blue Jays from playing home games in Pittsburgh over the same concerns."
474,17 Jersey Shore lifeguards test positive for coronavirus after partying,https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/17-new-jersey-lifeguards-test-positive-for-coronavirus/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
HARVEY CEDARS, N.J. — More than two dozen lifeguards from two New Jersey beach towns have tested positive for the coronavirus after having been together socially, authorities said.
Officials said the lifeguards are from Harvey Cedars and Surf City, neighboring boroughs on Long Beach Island.
Mayor Jonathan Oldham of Harvey Cedards said island health officials alerted the borough to the cluster Thursday and the lifeguards were being quarantined until they are cleared by doctors. Long Beach Island’s health director told WHYY that the guards were apparently together at two “social gatherings” earlier this month.
Harvey Cedars said Saturday that 17 lifeguards, all of whom had “attended a party in Surf City,” had tested positive for COVID-19. The island’s health director earlier said a dozen Surf City lifeguards had tested positive.
Harvey Cedars said on its website that it has 73 lifeguards and therefore “our beaches will remain fully staffed with all safety protocols in place.” Surf City said its beaches “will remain protected from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily” but “adjustments may be made from day to day to ensure the safety of all patrons and guards.”
New Jersey officials earlier announced more than 500 new positive COVID-19 cases and an additional 11 deaths confirmed as associated with the virus, bringing the total number of deaths associated with the virus in the state to 13,867."

ORLANDO, Fla. — More than 9,300 new coronavirus cases were reported in Florida on Sunday, accompanied by an additional 78 new deaths.
As of Sunday, Florida had 423,855 coronavirus cases, an additional 9,344 cases from the previous day, and 5,972 total deaths, according to the Florida Department of Health. Over the weekend, Florida surpassed New York State in having the second-highest caseload in the US, trailing only California.
The number of new cases was lower than other days last week, but caseloads released on Sundays tend to be smaller because of the lack of workers entering data or in labs testing samples.
The statewide median age of coronavirus patients in Florida was 40, the health department said.
Almost 3.4 million Floridians have been tested for the virus. The new cases tested over the weekend had a positive rate of 11%, according to the Department of Health.
New deaths were reported in Alachua, Broward, Dade, Duval, Escambia, Hardee, Hendry, Hernando, Hillsborough, Indian River, Lake, Marion, Martin, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Seminole, St. Lucie, Volusia and Walton counties.
The state health department recorded 781 COVID-19 deaths over the past week for an average of 126 deaths per day on Sunday, down slightly from Saturday’s weekly average of 127 deaths per day.
Florida had 8,951 coronavirus-related hospitalizations as of Sunday."

A comedian-musician seized on Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s distinctive speaking cadence — by setting one of his coronavirus press conferences to song.
NYC comedian Brooks Allison remixed Cuomo’s defense of his strict food-with-drinks requirement over guitar, bass and drums, with the instruments mirroring the executive’s sometimes-musical, sometimes-monotonous cadences.
“We opened outdoor dining,” Cuomo says at the beginning of the song, which Allison posted in an Instagram video on Saturday.
“Dining is you go with you friends, you sit at a table, you stay at the table and you only connect with… dining,” Cuomo says, at which point the beat drops and the word “dining” repeats eight times.
The song goes out on a breakdown using clips of Cuomo breaking down the differences between a “chicken wing” and “sandwiches.”
Cuomo’s rules mandate that bars and restaurants must serve “substantial” food in order to also serve alcohol.
Some restaurants had taken to selling “Cuomo chips” to meet the original requirement, which has been on the books since 1964.
On Thursday, Cuomo said chips and even chicken wings don’t cut it.
“To be a bar, you had to have food available — soups, sandwiches, etc. More than just hors d’oeuvres, chicken wings,” he said, in the original clip Allison remixed.
“You had to have some substantive food — the lowest level of substantive food were sandwiches.”"
477,How the Chiefs quelled Patrick Mahomes’ coronavirus concerns,https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/patrick-mahomes-coronavirus-concerns-quelled-by-chiefs/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"Since returning to the team’s practice facility, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is much more comfortable with the coronavirus safety protocols put in place after initially being concerned heading into training camp.
“It’s better than I thought coming in,” Mahomes told reporters Saturday. “That’s kind of put my mind at ease, knowing that I’m going to be put in the best possible situation given this time.”
The practice facility, as well as Arrowhead Stadium, implemented a series of new policies and restrictions in order to ensure the health of the players amid the coronavirus pandemic, including mask requirements, social distancing and plexiglass partitions between lockers, per ESPN. The NFL and the players’ union reached a deal on Friday on amendments to the CBA to play the 2020 NFL season, including safety protocols.
Chiefs rookies and some veterans have been allowed into the facility after two negative COVID-19 tests.
“I think the NFLPA did a good job getting all the players on the call and being prepared to be in the building and everything that entailed,” Mahomes said. “They’re really taking this thing seriously. They’re taking social distancing and wearing a mask seriously, so we’re not hurting each other or hurting other people out in the community with us being here.”
Chiefs head coach Andy Reid echoed his quarterback’s sentiment.
“People have gone to great ends to [protect players and coaches],” Reid said. “We’re as safe as you can be here. The dedication and staying disciplined when you leave this facility will be important. When you’re here, it’s a safe environment. You’ve got to continue that once you leave here.”
Once they can get through training camp, the Chiefs are scheduled to open the regular season against the Houston Texans Sept. 10."

There were 637 people hospitalized with the contagion statewide Saturday, the lowest daily figure since March 18, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.
“That’s a new low for us since March 18, so really great news,” the governor told reporters in a conference call.
The city recorded four hospitalizations Friday, the latest data available — tying its previous low on March 1.
The state also reported three confirmed deaths Saturday, while the city had seven, confirmed and suspected combined, Friday.
“What’s the but? The but is the constant caution of this virus,” Cuomo said Sunday. “Don’t get cocky, don’t get arrogant. There are still threats out there. You still have the national threat, and you have the compliance challenge.”
He crowed that the state also is holding steady with a 1 percent positive-test rate.
“New York did 53,568 tests [Saturday]. Five hundred and third six positive. That is 1 percent, on the head, positive,” the governor said.
He said that’s a key figure.
“I said from Day One, we’re going to calibrate the reopening. What did we calibrate it to? To the rate of transmission,” Cuomo said.
“What is the rate of transmission that you want to stay at? One [percent]. You don’t want to do over 1. … We are at that number. That’s the red line. We’re at the red line. So we are re-opening as fast as we can, and we are aggressive at reopening because we’re at the red line.
He said if things reopen too quickly, “that’s when the engine blows.”"
479,Nancy Pelosi nicknames Trump ‘Mr. Make Matters Worse’,https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/nancy-pelosi-nicknames-trump-mr-make-matters-worse/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday slammed President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and gave him the nickname “Mr. Make Matters Worse.”
“This president, I have a new name for him: Mr. Make Matters Worse. He has made matters worse from the start. Delay, denial, it’s a hoax, or going magically — it’s a miracle, and all the rest,” the California Democrat said on CBS News program “Face the Nation.”
Pelosi jabbed at Trump as Senate Republicans prepare to introduce coronavirus legislation on Monday after talks with the White House. House Democrats passed a rival $3 trillion bill in May.
The House speaker objected to a Republican liability waiver for employers and said she wants more money for school preparedness. Many other issues divide the parties, including the size of unemployment benefits and whether to bail out state governments.
Trump and Pelosi have had an acrimonious relationship, especially after her leadership in impeaching him in December for pushing Ukraine to investigate Democrats.
In May, the clash got ugly when Pelosi said on CNN that Trump should not be taking the drug hydroxychloroquine to protect against COVID-19 because he is “morbidly obese.”
Trump, in turn, told reporters at the Capitol that Pelosi is a “sick woman” with “mental problems.”
The next day, Pelosi claimed she’s spoken to doctors about Trump’s mental state and decided he’s “a confabulator — someone who just really doesn’t even know what the truth is.”
“It’s like a child who comes in with mud on their pants or something — that’s the way it is, they’re outside playing. He comes in with doggy doo on his shoes and everybody who works with him has that on their shoes, too,” she said."
480,Trump official admits COVID-19 test results take too long to come back, https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/trump-official-admits-coronavirus-test-results-take-too-long/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"President Trump’s point man on coronavirus testing in the US acknowledged Sunday that the turnaround time for results is too slow — with about half of the tests taking more than four days to come back.
Doctors have said speedy results are crucial to keeping the virus at bay, since the quicker people know they are infected, the faster they can isolate themselves.
“I started out by saying that we are never going to be happy with testing until we get turnaround times within 24 hours, and I would be happy with point-of-care [doctors’ office] testing everywhere. We are not there yet,” Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN’s “State of the Union.
“We are doing everything we can to do that.
“We need to continually improve our ecosystem.”
Giroir said roughly 25 percent of tests are done at doctors’ offices or clinics, where samples are handled in-house and results can come back as soon as 15 minutes.
Another 25 percent are performed at hospitals, where the turnaround is about 24 hours, he said.
“The delays that most people talk about are at the large commercial labs that perform about half the testing in our country,” Giroir said.
He said average turnaround at those sites is 4.27 days.
“I follow that morning and evening, I know exactly when it’s ordered and when it’s resulted,” the health official said. “We are trying to bring that down.”"

Mnuchin said plans crafted with Republican senators call for people who earn up to $75,000 to get the full amount.
People who earn more than $75,000 would get less money, and earners over $99,000 again would be left empty-handed.
The details of coronavirus legislation will be worked out during extensive negotiations between Republicans who hold the Senate and Democrats in the House. Both parties largely support more direct payments.
“We have the direct payments — and as you know, the direct payments are a much quicker way of effectively giving everybody a tax cut,” Mnuchin said on Sunday in an interview that aired on Fox News.
Details of the GOP proposal, including a possible income cap, are not yet published, but Mnuchin said Saturday the formula would remain the same for stimulus checks as in March when Congress passed the CARES Act.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Sunday on ABC News program “This Week” that Republicans are putting the “final touches” on the legislation.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday announced the outline of a $1 trillion Republican coronavirus bill to offset the economic harm of the pandemic. He did not state a dollar amount for direct payments.
It’s unclear if the direct payments will be in the core Republican bill or if it will be contained in its own legislation to sidestep an intra-party struggle with conservatives opposed to the spending.
“It won’t be in the base bill,” Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday.
Some Republican senators, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, oppose another round of stimulus checks.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), however, opposes smaller single-policy bills, potentially complicating the legislative path forward if the stimulus checks are not in a larger package.
A key battleline in negotiations is whether to continue a $600 per week boost in federal unemployment insurance.
Republicans generally want to reduce the amount to 70 percent of pre-pandemic pay, saying the previous boost could provide an incentive not to work.
President Trump supports another round of direct payments.
On Thursday, Mnuchin said, “the president’s preference is to make sure that we send out direct payments quickly so that in August, people get more money.”
There are likely to be protracted negotiations with House Democrats after Republican leaders in the Senate unveil their legislation on Monday. In May, House Democrats passed a $3 trillion bill that included direct payments along with bailouts for states and rent and mortgage assistance."
482,Cuomo blames NY Post for rising COVID-19 rates in Florida and Arizona,https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/cuomo-blames-ny-post-for-florida-and-arizonas-coronavirus-surges/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday blamed The Post for Florida and Arizona’s surging coronavirus cases.
“The Wall Street Journal, New York Post — they continue to beat a horse that is dead: ‘We should reopen the economy faster in New York,’ ‘The infection rate is low; re-open faster,'” Cuomo ranted to reporters during an early-morning conference call.
“The infection rate is low because we have done an intelligent, phased reopening. What they are advocating has been demonstrated to be wrong and to be a failure,” the governor continued.
“Florida listened to the New York Post. Texas listened to the Wall Street Journal. Arizona listened to the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. That was wrong. That was wrong.”
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his state’s stay-at-home order on April 29, according to CNN.
Arizona’s stay-at-home order expired on May 15. Gov. Doug Ducey permitted barbershop and salons to re-open on May 8, followed by indoor restaurants on May 11.
New York, where the virus has killed over 32,000 people — many in nursing homes, which were controversially required by Cuomo to admit or readmit recovering COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals — began a phase re-opening of its economy in early June.
Just 500 New Yorkers tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, and three more people died, Cuomo said.
Florida in comparison saw 12,199 new cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Arizona saw 3,740 new cases."
483,Mets’ Brad Brach thankful family OK after coronavirus scare,https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/mets-brad-brach-thankful-family-ok-after-coronavirus-scare/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"Brad Brach arrived in New York ahead of spring training 2.0, went to Citi Field to get his intake COVID-19 test and then went for lunch.
He couldn’t taste his sandwich.
“My stomach kind of dropped,” he said. 
The Mets reliever, who had previously just thought he had a cold, then realized what was coming — a positive test result — which forced him to miss the entire camp leading into Friday’s season opener. Brach’s wife, Jenae Cherry, who was late into her pregnancy, also tested positive, which added a scare to the situation.
But Brach finally returned to Citi Field on Saturday for the first time since, now that he, his wife and their new twin boys are all safe and healthy, after what the 34-year-old right-hander described as “pretty mild cases” of COVID-19.
“It was a tough couple weeks just because you don’t know how my wife’s going to react, how the boys are going to react to it,” Brach said Saturday afternoon on a Zoom call. “So it was a nerve-wracking time. Her biggest thing was that she wanted me to be there and we were hearing different things from the doctor that if I’m still testing positive, I can’t come. Or even if it was past 14 days, I couldn’t be there for the birth, so that was kind of the emotional roller-coaster I was on, more so than the baseball stuff because I knew that was going to be at least two or three weeks away.” 
Brach was ultimately allowed to be at the hospital for the birth of his twins, then helped his wife “settle back into life with three kids now,” before leaving to rejoin the Mets.
The New Jersey native threw a bullpen session Saturday at Citi Field before the Mets’ 5-3 loss to the Braves and came out feeling better than he expected. He plans to throw another bullpen in the coming days, then face live hitters and reassess his status.
Fellow reliever Jared Hughes also rejoined the team sometime last week, manager Luis Rojas said, after also missing most of camp for an undisclosed reason. Rojas said Hughes is “a little bit ahead” of Brach in his buildup, but declined to put a timeline on either pitcher’s return. Both will provide the Mets with important bullpen depth whenever they are deemed ready.
Aside from his biggest COVID-19-related concern — the health of his family — Brach said it was frustrating not being able to continue his baseball training while he was sick. During his quarantine, he tried to stay sharp by throwing into a tube sock and throwing weighted balls in his hotel room. He later went to find parks where nobody was and threw his bag of baseballs into the fence, he said.
“More than anything I was just frustrated because these last four or five months have been like a roller-coaster of emotions,” he said. “You think the season’s going to be over, then you hear it’s going to start next week, then you think it’s going to be over again. So when we finally got the word that spring 2.0 was starting back up, you’re just excited to get back and be around the guys.
“It’s just frustrating more than anything else because me and Steve Matz and a few of the other guys in the Nashville area, we put a lot of work in to be ready. Then to have all that washed away here these last two or three weeks, it’s frustrating but I’m hoping the work I put in before then shows up in the next couple weeks.”"
484,"NFL, coronavirus and less pressing issues as league opens",https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/nfl-coronavirus-and-less-pressing-issues-as-league-opens/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"Are you ready for some testing swabs?
A quarantining party?
We’ve got physical exams. And light conditioning exercises. And then maybe some football for your rowdy friends. 
These are not just the worst lyrics of all-time imagined for a “Monday Night Football” introduction. They are the realities of operating NFL training camps during the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting one overarching question: Can it be pulled off?
Rookies, quarterbacks and injured players began reporting to teams last week, but veterans are expected to be in place on time Tuesday, now that the league and its players association’s executive committee struck an agreement on new protocols and economics to avoid delaying the start of training camps.
Before the last-minute parameters were established Friday, some players privately felt “overwhelmed,” “confused” and “forced” by the uncertainty in private conversations with The Post. Thinking it was “unrealistic” went out the window when MLB returned to a traveling schedule, eschewing the bubble concept employed by the NBA.
It’s not exactly “problem solved” — clauses for how to act if the season is canceled are among the many reported terms of the updated CBA — but it’s a starting point.
Players must test negative for COVID-19 twice with 72 hours in between before entering a team facility, and physicals could be split over the course of multiple days. An asymptomatic player who tests positive has to leave camp and can’t return for 10 days or until testing negative twice in a five-day period, while a symptomatic player is banned for at least 10 days from the onset and 72 hours after symptoms subside.
A 20-day acclimation period of strength and conditioning workouts and non-contact walk-throughs doesn’t leave time for many true padded practices. Cue footage of old-school coaches complaining about the lack of hitting leading to sloppy play.
“The idea that this is going to go away with the snap of a finger and you don’t have to change, that’s not going to fly,” said NFLPA president J.C. Tretter, a center for the Browns. “Everything needs to be revamped and refitted to fit coronavirus. We can’t refit coronavirus around football.”
The four-game preseason schedule was completely eliminated. Roster sizes for camp must be cut from 90 to 80 by Aug. 16 in the name of finding space, except if employing split-squad practices. Any player can opt out and receive a stipend instead of his full contract, with added benefits for those with health risks.
So, some teams might not be at full strength, just like in the other sports. As of last week, NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said no players had decided not to play.
Fans won’t be hanging around the fences at camp, but some teams still are hoping for limited capacity regular-season attendance. The wide-ranging number of new cases in different states requires non-uniformity.
“Everything that we’re doing is centered around the concept of risk mitigation,” NFL chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills said. “We know that we can’t eliminate risk. We know that this is going to be a shared responsibility.” 
Rams offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth — one of 59 players to test positive as of Tuesday, according to the union — sent shock waves through his peers when he revealed a family member went to lunch with a friend, and a couple days later he, his wife, their four children and his in-laws tested positive. His father-in-law was hospitalized.
“It doesn’t take much,” Whitworth said, “and it can spread like wildfire.”
That’s why some league sources told The Post the right path would have been to mandate team-wide hotel stays, like a return to yesteryear when “training camp, essentially, is a quarantine … but instead of a hot dorm in Podunk trying to figure out how to get air in your room, you are in a luxury hotel.”
Remote camps were banned this year in favor of running the operation out of team headquarters. So, at least it’s convenient in case someone needs to run through the doors and shout, “Let’s call the whole thing off!”
Here are 10 other NFL storylines for training camp:
Cam Newton starts, right? Newton was anointed Tom Brady’s replacement by the public as soon as he signed. But the Patriots made no starting guarantee to the former MVP. It’s easy to shrug off the notion of competing against Jarrett Stidham, but they wouldn’t have waited until June to make a move if they weren’t high on the youngster.
The Bears’ Nick Foles-Mitch Trubisky and Raiders’ Derek Carr-Marcus Mariota both involve former No. 2-overall draft picks trying to salvage careers. Foles is trying to prove he can win outside of Philadelphia. Will the Chargers’ Justin Herbert or Dolphins’ Tua Tagovailoa win jobs as rookies from veteran challengers?
Tom Brady learning a new offense for the first time in 20 years is fascinating. An unretired Rob Gronkowski getting back into a rhythm is fascinating. What do you call it when two future Hall of Famers are performing those tasks in the same camp run by the unpredictable Bruce Arians? All eyes on the Buccaneers.
The new collective bargaining agreement is harder on holdouts — no more forgiving $50,000 daily fines once a new contract is in place. The Jaguars’ Yannick Ngakoue headlines the disgruntled trade-seekers. The Vikings’ Dalvin Cook wants a new deal. The Saints’ Alvin Kamara and Bengals’ Joe Mixon could, too.
A young Aaron Rodgers didn’t appreciate the cold shoulder from the great Brett Favre. Now we’ll see how helpful Rodgers, 36, is to successor Jordan Love. Is Love a project or more game-ready than some think? Rodgers wanted the Packers to draft a playmaker instead. Awkward!
Drew Brees didn’t retire after a third straight walk-off playoff loss because he is chasing immortality — a second Super Bowl to go with career passing records. But he angered teammates with his “disrespecting the flag” comments in June. He apologized and vowed to be an ally in the fight for racial equality, but will any divisiveness linger in the locker room?
Commissioner Roger Goodell endorsed a team signing Colin Kaepernick. Several coaches say he deserves another chance. So, who’s going to give it to him? Will he take it? His name will surface with every quarterback injury. Because no preseason games means no national anthem and no kneeling, how will players get across their message?
Anyone want a Pro Bowl-caliber pass-rusher or cornerback? It’s beyond strange that Jadeveon Clowney, Everson Griffen and Logan Ryan remain unsigned. Yes, the pandemic made teams reluctant to spend, but good players still get paid. Clowney and Griffen fit the Seahawks and Titans. Ryan fits the Giants, Jets, Lions and Dolphins.
Todd Gurley’s release at a $20.1 million dead-money, salary-cap hit was stunning, even with the Rams trending downward. Gurley led the NFL in yards from scrimmage in 2017 and rushing touchdowns in 2018, as the Rams went to the Super Bowl. Did injuries finish him that quickly? Or did the Falcons get a free-agent steal?
Fans who say they will stop taking the joy of games for granted might last one quarter of Week 1 before complaining about officiating. No preseason is a loss for the rusty crews. Officials typically get extra work in touring camps, but there likely won’t be much 11-on-11 to see until later. How will they get ready in August?"
485,NHL clears first coronavirus hurdle but now comes big test,https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/nhl-passes-first-coronavirus-test-but-now-comes-the-hard-part/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"The Stanley Cup tournament will provide pockets of normalcy in this unique time. That will be most welcome. Truth be told, having the opportunity to go to the practice rink and watch the Rangers go through mid-summer drills at, for the most part, mid-summer pace, represented a welcome turn of normalcy.
And now the games will begin in Toronto and Edmonton as the NHL enters its two bubble hubs and life under lockdown for up to 10 weeks for the teams that emerge as Cup finalists. We’ll chart the victories and defeats, goals and saves, xGF, Corsi and all the peripherals.
But as the league enters its twin cocoons, health and safety are paramount. The two weeks of the NHL’s Phase 3 training camp went so well, it is almost miraculous. If you look at hockey and hockey alone, you could forget the United States is enduring a raging pandemic that has no end in sight.
That is a credit to the leadership of the NHL and the NHLPA, which worked methodically for months in collaboration with infectious disease experts and health officials across the U.S. and Canada to develop safety protocols. That is a credit to the medical trainers, equipment people and team physicians who have implemented these mandates. And that is also a credit to the athletes, who have adhered to the created guidelines and have come back from their hiatus with the best of intentions.
Plus, who wants to be the guy (or among the group of guys) who is so careless or so selfish that he would risk undermining the entire enterprise for a few moments of frivolity or earthly pleasures? Anonymity would not exist for that hypothetical individual, no matter how much the PA might want to protect his identity.
Ah. Risk. Again, it has all gone so well in rinks across the continent this last fortnight, it is easy to forget that the players, staffs, NHL officials and employees entering the hermetically sealed environment are indeed taking a risk by being there.
Yes, exposure to civilians will be limited and rare, and yes, testing will be ubiquitous, but there is no guarantee that the NHL will be able to pull this off. By reporting the mundane — the choice of the No. 1 goaltender, which top line might be hottest, which first-year players might make the greatest impact, etc. — we imply that a safe environment should be taken for granted.
It is, however, probably closer to the truth that it will be somewhat of a miracle if the NHL can pull off a venture this massive and of this magnitude. If a Stanley Cup champion is crowned in late September or early October, it will represent the greatest success in the history of the league. In that case, we’d suggest that even the cardboard cutouts in the stands would be moved enough to give Gary Bettman a standing ovation when he presents the chalice to Henrik Lundqvist.
(Just wanted to make sure you’re still with me.)
There are surely questions we should ask ourselves about the priorities of a society and culture in which thousands of tests per day will be performed and turned around within 24 hours for Pro $port$ League$ while most of us remain hostage to the chaos promulgated by the federal government, but it is not hockey’s responsibility to answer for it.
No one knows exactly what to expect, but I do expect the hockey to be extremely competitive right out of the gate. The 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the USSR began on Sept. 2. The 1996 World Cup of Hockey ended with Game 3 of the finals on Sept. 14. Thus, there is an abundance of high-quality summer hockey that serves as evidence of what motivated players can do even if beginning with a standing start.
The league is going to attempt to tailor the rinks with each team’s unique hometown flavor in Toronto and Edmonton. Whether “Potvin Sucks” following the whistle that ignites the four decades-old chant will be part of the package for Game 3, Rangers vs. Candy Canes, is as yet unknown. There is that word again.
It is all ahead of us. It is all ahead of the NHL. We have spent a lifetime familiarizing ourselves with the defensive zone, the neutral zone and the offensive zone, and about red, blue and checkered lines. Now we talk about the bubble zone. Now we talk about lines that cannot be crossed in the effort to keep the virus away from the rink. 
The goal is to crown a Stanley Cup champion. But the overriding objective is for everyone to remain safe. Let’s be careful out there."
486,North Korea declares emergency as first suspected COVID-19 case reported,https://nypost.com/2020/07/26/north-korea-declares-emergency-as-first-covid-19-case-reported/,2020-07-26 00:00:00,"SEOUL – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared an emergency and a lockdown in a border town after a person suspected of being infected with the novel coronavirus returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border, state media said on Sunday.
If confirmed, it would be the first case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities.
Kim convened an emergency politburo meeting in response to what he called a “critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country”, the North’s KCNA state news reported.
A person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two Koreas to the town of Kaesong this month with symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, KCNA reported.
“An emergency event happened in Kaesong City where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on July 19 after illegally crossing the demarcation line,” KCNA said.
KCNA did not say if the person had been tested, but said an “uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person’s upper respiratory organ and blood”, prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.
One analyst said the announcement was important, not only because North Korea was for the first time reporting a suspected coronavirus case but also because it suggested it was appealing for help.
“It’s an ice-breaking moment for North Korea to admit a case,” said Choo Jae-woo, a professor at Kyung Hee University.
“It could be reaching out to the world for help. Perhaps for humanitarian assistance.”
North Korea is under huge economic pressure because of international sanctions over its nuclear program.
Cho Han-bum, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said it was significant that North Korea was reporting its first suspected coronavirus case was imported.
“North Korea is in such a dire situation, where they can’t even finish building the Pyongyang General Hospital on time. Pointing the blame at an ‘imported case’ from South Korea, the North can use this as a way to openly accept aid from the South,” Cho said.
KCNA did not elaborate on how the “runaway” had crossed one of the world’s most heavily guarded borders but said the incident was being investigated and the military unit responsible would face “severe punishment”.
South Korean officials were checking to see if a defector had indeed crossed back into the North this month, the South’s Yonhap news agency reported.
North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries and imposed strict border closures.
Thousands of people in North Korea were also quarantined as it took precautions to prevent a coronavirus outbreak but restrictions had recently been eased."
487,Hundreds gather without masks for annual ‘White Trash Bash’ boat event,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/hundreds-gather-without-masks-for-annual-white-trash-bash-boat-event/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"Hundreds of people, many without masks, turned up for the 10th annual “White Trash Bash” in Illinois over the weekend — despite authorities warning that coronavirus cases are on the rise in the area, according to a local report.
At least 200 boats filled with revelers packed the Illinois River in East Peoria on Saturday for the all-day bash that consists of drinking and socializing in large groups, WMBD reported.
None of the around 500 partygoers were seen wearing masks or practicing social distancing, according to the outlet.
Authorities had issued a warning ahead of the blowout, reminding folks that “Covid 19 numbers are increasing in our area.”
“This event has the potential to expose everyone to the virus,” the Fon du Lac Park District Police Department wrote on Facebook.
“Please use common sense and social distancing.”
But ultimately, officials said, there isn’t much they can do to ensure that attendees stay mindful of the virus.
“We try to have people voluntarily social distance,” Fon Du Lac Park District director Mike Johnson told the outlet, “but at the end of the day, the goal is to get through this event and get everyone home safe.”
The Prairie State has more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 7,500 deaths, according to the latest figures from the Illinois Department of Public Health.

488,Eagles coach Doug Pederson tests positive for coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/eagles-coach-doug-pederson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"Eagles coach Doug Pederson tested positive for coronavirus, the team announced Sunday.
The Super Bowl-winning coach told his players the news during an unscheduled team meeting on Sunday after a second positive test, according to ESPN. 
“Pederson is asymptomatic and doing well,” the Eagles said in a statement. “He is currently in self-quarantine and in
communication with the team’s medical staff. The organization is following the protocols established by the NFL and the NFLPA. Any individuals in close contact with Pederson at our facility have been notified and will continue with daily testing
procedures and compliance with all protocols before returning to the facility.”
It is believed Pederson, 52, contracted the virus outside of the Eagles facility, according to ESPN. He will need to register multiple negative tests before he can return to work.
Pederson is the second NFL coach to test positive for coronavirus — following the since-recovered Saints coach Sean Payton — but is the first to do so since teams started gathering for training camp. The Eagles are scheduled to open the regular season Sept. 13 against the Washington Football team."
489,Yankees take advantage of baseball’s coronavirus issues: Sherman,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/yankees-take-advantage-of-baseballs-coronavirus-issues-sherman/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"Players, coaches and managers will let you know they do not make the schedule. They play who is put in front of them and however that works out, it works out.
If this is the week in which your opponent doesn’t have its starting quarterback or point guard, luck of the draw. If you are playing too many day games after night games or your West Coast trips are particularly ill-timed, your executives probably lobbied to change it before it became official, but here you are.
This major league season, though, has put all these concepts through the looking glass. Which players are available daily has never been more in question since a common cold now will put a player on the injured list until he tests a few times to demonstrate it is not COVID-19. Which opponent you are playing and where has become a multiple choice question.
No team is going to be immune from the implications — flexibility is going to mean a lot more than if a player can kick his leg up above his head. But clearly greater advantages and disadvantages will be derived. The Blue Jays, for example, have no home games in their actual Toronto home. The Marlins, when they are scheduled to restart Tuesday, will have had to alter more than half a roster decimated by COVID-19. The Phillies did not play in the last week due to proximity to the infested Marlins, which could mean as many as 57 games in 56 days if they are to complete a 60-game schedule.
Conversely, the Yankees, to date, have benefited more than most. Again, no club is immune. DJ LeMahieu missed most of spring training 2.0 with the virus, and Luis Cessa and Aroldis Chapman are just returning now. Does Tommy Kahnle need Tommy John surgery because of the build up, shut down, build up reality of a re-start that has seen a spree of pitching injuries. The Yankees last week were stuck two days in Philadelphia without playing, were about to return home perhaps to play the Phillies and then pivoted to Baltimore to play the Orioles.
But even in that last one, you see the glimmer. There is no such thing as a sure win in the majors, but putting the Yankees in Camden Yards is as close as you get.
What else aided and abetted the Yankees in a 6-1 start?
— Juan Soto learned just hours before the season opener that he was COVID-19 positive. So the defending champs lost the best hitter from a lineup that already was without Anthony Rendon (signed with the Angels) and Ryan Zimmerman (opted out of the season).
The Nationals won once against the Yankees — the middle game of the three-game set in which Stephen Strasburg was scratched with nerve pain in his right hand. Which emphasizes that not every gift is opened.
— If your season is going to be impacted by COVID-19, there is a blessing to being in the right place at the right time. The Yankees had two games in Philadelphia postponed, but rather than have to go on an extended hiatus and risk losing the edge of playing, they were able to go to Baltimore to play because the Orioles were supposed to be facing the Marlins. Thus, the Marlins and Phillies were shut down, but the Yankees were able to keep on playing. Comparatively — as an example — the Nationals will have four days off before playing Tuesday because over the weekend they were supposed to play the Marlins.
— The Red Sox have just one quality starter and the Yankees missed Nathan Eovaldi because he pitched Wednesday against the Mets. In addition, Eduardo Rodriguez will not pitch this season due to a heart issue the Red Sox believe is a ramification of the lefty having had COVID-19. The only two Red Sox pitchers with sustained success against the Yankees last year were Eovaldi and Rodriguez.
— The Phillies will have gone seven days without playing when they face the Yankees in The Bronx on Monday. They were put on ice to await to see if any of their personnel contracted coronavirus after playing three games against the Marlins. No Phillie player tested positive. The team has had three workouts.
“It is human nature to think why us or poor Phillies, ‘Why did this happen,’ ” Jake Arrieta told Philadelphia reporters Sunday. “But once you have that initial thought and get it out of your head and turn the page, then it is time to think what do we have to do to stay ready; as ready as we possibly can, even though it is difficult.”
Nevertheless, a good attitude isn’t as valuable as continuing to face strong competition. Arrieta said with simulated games and bullpen sessions he is good for at least 80-90 pitches in his Monday 2020 debut. But expect Phillies manager Joe Girardi to be cautious in how much he extends any of his arms in the short run considering the rampant pitching injuries consuming the game.
That should be another advantage Yankees in this bizarre season."
490,Business leader says wealthy New Yorkers ‘don’t want to come back’ to the city,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/business-leader-says-wealthy-new-yorkers-wont-come-back-to-the-city/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"Wealthy New Yorkers who fled the city during the coronavirus crisis “don’t want to come back” — and may be further deterred by talk of rising taxes, an economic watchdog warned Sunday.
“They want to go to the office, but they don’t want to come back to the city,” Partnership for NYC President Kathryn Wylde said Sunday on WABC 770 AM’s “The Cats Roundtable” radio show.
“It’s hard to move a company… but it’s much easier for individuals to move,” she said, noting that most offices plan to allow remote work indefinitely.
The top one-percent of earners currently account for 40 percent of New York state tax revenue, according to numbers crunched by Wylde’s pro-business group last month.
New York state faces massive deficits due to the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, leading some left-wing politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to suggest raising taxes on billionaires.
Wylde warned that rich New Yorkers will be even more inclined to stay in the Hamptons or Palm Beach, Florida, if New York raises taxes.
“I am very concerned about all the demonstrations against billionaires,” said Wylde, whose group’s members include Fortune 500 companies, international tech firms, real-estate titans and the New York Post’s parent company News Corp, according to the Partnership’s website.
“The threats of raising taxes on the wealthy. That concerns me, because we should be… trying to figure out how to get the half million people who left the city for the COVID… to come back.”
She added, “It’s a big concern that we’re going to lose more of our tax base then we’ve already lost.”"
491,"New Jersey gym owners defy COVID-19 lockdown again, kick down boarded-up door",https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/new-jersey-gym-owners-defy-covid-19-lockdown-again/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"The defiant owners of a New Jersey gym that has repeatedly ignored coronavirus lockdown orders literally kicked their way back to business over the weekend.
Ian Smith and Frank Trumbetti, the owners of Atilis Gym in Bellmawr, who were arrested last week for opening in violation of the state restrictions, kicked down the boarded-up front door to the business Saturday.
They even posted the event on Instagram, with a message slamming New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy.
“I hate the fact that it has to come to this,” Smith, 33, wrote. “Governor Murphy can portray us in whatever villainous way he wants, but our hands are forced here and that’s his fault.”
“We are over 4 months into an economic shutdown that was supposed to be 14 days,” he said. “It’s time to end this and resume life in a safe and responsible manner.”
The two gym owners have had a months-long feud with the governor, and have repeatedly been forced to shut down. They sued the state for the right to open, but a judge ruled last week that they had to vacate the facility amid the state restrictions.
State health officials have determined that indoor gyms and fitness facilities “present particularly high-risk settings for the spread of COVID-19.”
The state Attorney General’s Office has consistently agreed and said enforcement actions against Atilis have been necessary because the owners have repeatedly defied court orders to keep their doors locked.
Smith and Trumbetti, however, contend that their abbreviated openings have complied with social distancing requirements and other measures to combat the spread of the deadly pandemic.
“They continue to protest the continued unconstitutional enforcement of these ridiculous executive orders,” their attorney, James Mermigis, said in an email to The Post Sunday. “This is a personal attack by the governor against my clients. The governor has engaged in one hypocrisy after another yet chooses to single out my clients.”
He called Murphy’s shutdown order “random and arbitrary,” and said state health officials have yet to inspect the gym to evaluate the safety precautions the two owners put in place."
492,Cardinals’ coronavirus outbreak is getting worse,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/cardinals-have-more-coronavirus-cases-after-latest-tests/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The St. Louis Cardinals’ season could remain on hold.
With their weekend series in Milwaukee postponed after multiple players and staff members tested positive for COVID-19, the Cardinals expected even more new positive test results on Sunday, according to multiple reports. The fast-tracked tests taken by the team Sunday morning were expected to be ready at night.
The Cardinals previously knew of four confirmed cases of the coronavirus, consisting of three players and one coach. Additionally, the team had several tests come back with inconclusive results, leading to team members being tested twice Sunday.
As the Cardinals waited for the results of the new round of tests, their four-game series set to start Tuesday against the Tigers remained on the schedule. However, the newest results could trigger another postponement and more alterations of multiple schedules. The Marlins and Phillies each haven’t played in a week, following an outbreak on Miami, impacting at least 18 players.
The Cardinals have been quarantined at their hotel in Milwaukee this weekend.
“It’s really trying times right now,” Cardinals president of baseball operations John Mozeliak told MLB Network Radio. “Fingers crossed we can get to a point where our curve flattens.”
On Saturday night, Mozeliak told reporters the team wasn’t concerned with the virus becoming a bigger problem.
“We’re confident, by the time we get to Detroit on Monday, that we will have control of this,” Mozeliak said.
The severity of the spread on the Cardinals — and beyond — could doom the league’s 60-game season.
On Friday, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told MLB Players Association executive director Tony Clark that the league could shut down play if the sport doesn’t effectively contain the coronavirus. ESPN reported the season could be canceled as soon as Monday, with MLB reportedly telling its broadcast partners to have alternate programming prepared, in the event of the season’s premature end.
“We had someone that was infected and unfortunately it was someone that was able to spread it,” Mozeliak said. “Containing is now our main focus.”"

California has become the first US state to record more than a half-million cases of the coronavirus — as New York City and state reported they are holding steady on their low figures.
As of Saturday, the Golden State registered 509,162 cases of the contagion — and set a grim new daily record for itself of 176 related fatalities a day earlier, according to its web site.
Those deaths helped put the country’s daily coronavirus fatality total over 1,000 for the sixth day in a row.
Meanwhile, New York reported its least number of hospitalizations Saturday, 556, since March 17 and three deaths, part of a rolling three-day average that was the lowest for the state since the pandemic took hold, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office.
The state’s positive-test rate also was 0.9, while the city’s was 1.0.
The city had no deaths yesterday, said the state, which offered fresher numbers than the ones on the Big Apple’s Web site, although not including presumed COVID-19 deaths, only confirmed ones.
“We’ve now conducted over 6 million tests, and the numbers are just about where we want them to be, which is all very good news and says that our plan is working,” Cuomo said in a statement.
“However, context is important, and there are storm clouds on the horizon in the form of new cases throughout the country, and a lack of compliance here in the state, and I urge New Yorkers to stay New York Smart and local governments to properly enforce state guidance.”
He said the state Liquor Authority and State Police Task Force went to 1,070 bars, restaurants and other establishments in the city and on Long Island on Saturday and found that 36 were not in compliance with health guidelines amid the virus.
According to the state, there were: 18 scofflaw establishments in Queens; 10 in Manhattan; five in The Bronx; one on Staten Island and two in Suffolk County on Long Island."
494,36 cruise crew members test positive for COVID-19 after sailing with hundreds of tourists,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/36-cruise-ship-crew-members-test-positive-for-covid-19/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"A Norwegian cruise ship sailed around with hundreds of passengers on two trips before docking, disembarking the tourists — and learning 36 of its crew members had the coronavirus.
The liner company, Hurtigruten, said it only learned of the contagion outbreak among its workers Friday — two weeks after the ship’s recent first trip and a week after the second.
Now, “209 guests from the first voyage [July 17] and 178 guests from the July 24 departure will self-quarantine in line with Norwegian health authority regulations,” Hurtigruten said in a statement Saturday.
“We work closely with the Norwegian national and local health authorities for follow-up, information, further testing, and infection tracking.”
The company said four of the 158 crew members aboard its MS Roald Amundsen “were isolated several days ago because of other disease symptoms, showing no symptoms of COVID-19.”
Then “they were routinely tested,” found to have the coronavirus and admitted to a hospital in Tromso, Norway, on Friday morning.
The other 32 workers who have since returned positive tests have not “shown any signs of disease or symptoms of COVID-19,” the liner said.
The ship had been set to sail again, for the Svalbard archipelago in Norway, on Friday afternoon, but that trip was cancelled, the company said.
Cruise ships became so synonymous with coronavirus outbreaks at the start of the pandemic this past spring that one major line — Royal Caribbean — dropped “Cruises” from its name last week. The industry has said it is flailing over continuing fears about catching the contagion aboard the ships."
495,Families plead for New York to relax COVID-19 rules on visiting nursing homes,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/families-plead-for-ny-to-relax-covid-19-nursing-homes-rules/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
ALBANY — Fewer than 20 percent of New York’s nursing homes have reopened to visitors amid the coronavirus — and now family members desperate to see their loved ones again are calling for the state to relax the requirements.
Out of the state’s 613 nursing homes, 117 have received approval from Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s state Health Department to accept outside visitors since July 15, after facilities were shut to non-essential visits due to COVID-19 worries on March 13.
To allow guests again, facilities must clear a high threshold of proving they have gone 28 days without recording a single positive case in either a resident or staff member. If some tests positive, the nursing home must reset back to day 1.
The situation is now proving frustrating those eager to see grandparents, parents and other loved ones after four long months.
Sisters Karen Skinner, 61, and Stephanie Stewart, 58, of Dutchess County, haven’t seen their 85-year-old mother Mimi Nichols since March.
Mimi lives in the New York State Veterans’ Home in Montrose, but was unable to see her daughters and 86-year-old husband John Nichols on her birthday July 19 because the facility has yet to meet state requirements.
“March was our last real visit. My family had two window visits in July and she cried when she saw us. This is so cruel to keep her from her husband and daughters and grandchildren,” Karen told The Post, adding at this rate it doesn’t seem like they will be seeing their mom until a vaccine is produced.
The sisters started a petition last week seeking to reduce the 28-day rule instead to 14 days, and have thus far garnered 254 signatures with a goal of 1,000.
“We are asking for outside visits with masks and social distancing,” she added, explaining it’s a temporary solution at least before the winter months kick in — or a second wave.
Kim Lancaster, 57, of Peekskill signed the petition because she is also desperate to see her dad Bill Lancaster, 81, who has been at the VA since 2017 and has Alzheimer’s.
“It’s been very hard on my mom especially, he did remember her but she thinks he’s forgotten all about her at this point,” she said, adding that her 81-year-old mother Regina Lancaster used to see her husband regularly before the pandemic, and has only been able to make a window visit once, but abandoned the idea because “it’s too confusing for him.”
“She’s losing precious time.”
Federal guidance issued last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services say nursing homes may allow visitors if they meet that 28-day mark as long as “there have been no new, nursing home onset COVID-19 cases in the nursing home” during that period.
Nursing home industry sources told The Post New York’s guidance goes beyond the federal standard — as it covers any staff or resident coronavirus case recorded, even if it didn’t derive from the facility itself.
They want the state to go back and adopt the federal guidance instead, ensuring only coronavirus cases borne directly from a facility qualify.
A July 10 DOH press release confirms New York’s directive also goes further: “Although CMS guidance only references new onset resident cases during the past 28 days, New York has gone further to protect our most vulnerable, and based on statistics nationwide, the policies support those decisions.”
Stephen Hanse, President and CEO of the NYS Health Facilities Association — which represents over 400 nursing homes and assisted living facilities — said he’s also lobbying the state to adopt a 14-day visitation rule.
“We took a poll of our members and 75 percent of facilities are not able to open as a consequence of the 28-day COVID-19 free restriction,” he said.
“Consequently, NYSHFA has requested the State to adopt a 14-day COVID-19 free restriction that would mirror the 14-day quarantine period for nursing home and assisted living staff.”
The directive also complicates visitations for nursing homes serving kids — like the Elizabeth Seton Children’s Center in Yonkers, one of just six nursing homes dedicated full-time to pediatric care out of 16 homes total that have pediatric beds.
The facility hasn’t recorded a resident case in 150 days among 169 sick kids, but weekly testing of roughly 700 employees continues to trigger the 28-day rule — at an average infection rate of .6 percent, less than the state’s own total average, according to the facility.
Rachel Amar, 50, hasn’t seen her son 18-year-old Max since March. He’s 100 percent dependent on a ventilator and requires full staff support in order to move, as he sits in a wheelchair and wears a neck brace.
“The kids need to see their parents. The kids are acting up and the parents give them love, it’s impossible they can get the love that a parent gives from the staff,” Amar told The Post.
She’s advocating for visitation to resume in line with DOH standards governing a hospital’s pediatric ward, which allows up to two parents to visit the bedside of their kids.
“You wake up, you get to see your kids and see them in your house. I can’t do that. I need to see him just as much. This is my life, he’s my life,” adding she has visited Max in the Children’s Center every day for the past 14 years.
As of Saturday, 209 facilities have qualified to reopen for visitors, but only 117 have submitted plans to the DOH.
“As we said from the beginning, science and safety would guide our decision to resume visitations to nursing homes, and it has,” DOH spokeswoman Jill Montag said in a statement.
Montag continued: “The number of facilities that are eligible to reopen to visitors, and the number that have taken the next step, shows they are appropriately adhering to CMS guidelines with smart and cautious plans for visitation. Given the increase in cases nationally, we commend them for all they – and all New Yorkers – have done to flatten the curve and to stay safe.”
The virus has claimed the lives of over 6,300 nursing homes residents in the state since March according to state records.
The state Legislature is slated to hold the first of two hearings assessing the DOH’s handling of the virus in nursing homes and other long term care facilities tomorrow, Monday, Aug. 3. The second is scheduled for Aug. 10."
496,Meadows says he’s ‘not optimistic’ COVID-19 relief deal will be reached soon,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/white-house-not-optimistic-covid-19-relief-deal-will-be-reached-soon/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Sunday expressed little confidence that a deal will be reached soon on a fourth coronavirus stimulus package.
“We still have a long ways to go,” Meadows, one of the chief negotiators, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” after a week of stalled talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
“Yesterday was a step in the right direction. I’m not optimistic there will be a solution in the very near term.”
With Congress unable to agree on a fourth aid package, the White House last week dispatched Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to negotiate with Democrats as the $600 per week boost to unemployment benefits was set to expire.
But the negotiations have proved fruitless and jobless benefits ended at midnight on Friday with no deal in sight, affecting tens of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs amid the pandemic.
Meadows has repeatedly blamed Pelosi and Schumer who he accused of rejecting a handful of offers this week to extend the benefits.
“If you have unemployed people that have lost their enhanced unemployment, they need to call their Democrat senators and House members, because they’re the ones standing in the way,” Meadows said Sunday.
President Trump also blamed Schumer and Pelosi in a series of tweets Friday.
Unemployment benefits have been the central issue in the negotiations. Republicans want to reduce the payments to $200 per week while Democrats are pushing to extend the current $600 rate to the first few months of 2021.
Both sides do however agree on a second round of stimulus checks worth up to $1,200.
Pelosi (D. Calif) was equally despondent on negotiations in an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” saying, “We will be close to an agreement when we have an agreement.”
When asked what she would say to Americans who have lost their benefits, Pelosi said: “Talk to President Trump. He’s the one who’s standing in the way of that.”
The speaker also pushed back on Meadows’ claim that he had made several offers, accusing Republicans of being in disarray while Democrats are in total agreement over the need for a $600-per-week boost to state unemployment.
“The idea that they made a proposal is really not actually factual,” she said.
Appearing on “This Week” immediately after Pelosi, Mnuchin said he believed the jobless payments led to many Americans being “overpaid” and argued it discouraged them from returning to the workforce.
“Unemployment is supposed to be a wage replacement, so it should be tied to some percentage of wages,” he said, saying that the only reason why Americans received a flat $600 rate is because of “30-year-old computer systems.”
“I think on the concept, we absolutely agree on enhanced unemployment. We want to fix the issue where in some cases people are overpaid.”
“There’s no question that in some cases where we’re paying people more to stay home than to work, that’s created issues in the entire economy,” he said.
At a press conference in Manhattan on Sunday, Schumer accused Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of “dithering” on negotiations and failing to engage with a rival $3 trillion bill the House passed in May.
“While it is a positive step that the White House is finally willing to make progress on these negotiations, significant divisions remain,” he said, calling for eviction protections and additional money for struggling state authorities.
“Months of delay and dithering by Leader McConnell has made all of this a lot harder, but when it comes to ensuring New York and the country have the funding needed to overcome the crisis, Democrats cannot waiver,” he continued.
“The pandemic has put about 1.8 million New Yorkers on unemployment, risks nearly a million people evicted, and marks a financial doomsday for local budgets that support sanitation workers, firefighters, teachers and more. We have to make sure these are the folks that get the help,” he said."
497,Scientists study virus transmission after COVID-19 outbreaks at mink farms,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/scientists-study-covid-19-outbreaks-among-minks-in-europe/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"MADRID — Coronavirus outbreaks at mink farms in Spain and the Netherlands have scientists digging into how the animals got infected and if they can spread it to people.
In the meantime, authorities have killed more than 1 million minks at breeding farms in both countries as a precaution.
The virus that first infected people in China late last year came from an animal source, probably bats, and later spread from person to person, as other coronaviruses had done in the past. Some animals, including cats, tigers and dogs, have picked up the new coronavirus from people, but there hasn’t been a documented case of animals spreading it back to humans.
The outbreaks among the minks on farms in the Netherlands and Spain likely started with infected workers, although officials aren’t certain. But it also is “plausible” that some workers later caught the virus back from the minks, the Dutch government and a researcher said, and scientists are exploring whether that was the case and how much of a threat such a spread might be.
The outbreak at the Spanish mink farm near La Puebla de Valverde, a village of 500 people, was discovered after seven of the 14 employees, including the owner, tested positive in late May, said Joaquín Olona, regional chief of agriculture and environment. Two other employees got infected even after the operation was shut down.
More than 92,000 minks were ordered killed at the farm in the Aragon region of northeastern Spain, with nine out of 10 animals estimated to have contracted the virus.
After the Dutch outbreaks began in April, professor Wim van der Poel, a veterinarian who studies viruses at Wageningen University and Research, determined that the virus strain in the animals was similar to the one circulating among humans.
“We assumed it was possible that it would be transmitted back to people again,” the virus expert said, and that’s what appeared to have happened with at least two of the infected workers.
Richard Ostfeld, a researcher at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York, said that if confirmed, these would be the first known instances of animal-to-human transmission.
“With the evidence for farmed mink-to-human transmission, we definitely need to be concerned with the potential for domesticated animals that are infected to pass on their infection to us,” Ostfeld said by email.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to humans and then spread between people, but it adds that this is rare.
Both the World Health Organization and the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health are studying the transmission of the virus between animals and people. Several universities and research institutes also are examining the issue.
The WHO has noted that the transmission on the mink breeding farms could have happened both ways. But WHO’s Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said at a news conference last month that such transmission was “very limited.”
“This gives us some clues about which animals may be susceptible to infection and this will help us as we learn more about the potential animal reservoir of (the virus),” she said, referring to cases in the Netherlands and Denmark, another major producer of mink fur.
While scientists think the virus originated in bats, it may have passed through another animal before infecting people. A WHO team is currently in China, planning to study the issue.
More than 1.1 million minks have been killed on 26 Dutch farms that recorded outbreaks, according to the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority. The government announced Thursday that minks at a 27th farm also were infected and would be killed.
The Netherlands, which has some 160 mink farms, is the world’s fourth-biggest producer of the prized fur after Denmark, China and Poland, according to Wim Verhagen, director of the Dutch federation of fur farmers. Spain has 38 active mink breeding operations, most of them in northwestern Galicia.
Both Spain and the Netherlands have tightened hygiene protocols at mink farms and banned transportation of the animals and visits to the buildings where they are kept.
China, which produces about a third of the mink fur market, and the United States have not reported any virus outbreaks in minks or in animals at other farms."
498,Phillies on track to resume season against Yankees after coronavirus scare,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/phillies-have-no-new-covid-19-cases-set-to-resume-play-monday/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"The Phillies look ready to return to the field.
Having had all games since last Sunday postponed after playing the Marlins — who’ve had 21 individuals test positive for COVID-19 since their series in Philadelphia — the Phillies announced they had no new positive cases in their most recent round of tests, and will resume their schedule Monday at Yankee Stadium.
The Phillies had three staff members test positive for the coronavirus after facing the Marlins, but MLB said Saturday it believed two of the cases may have been false positives. Philadelphia was permitted to hold staggered workouts at Citizens Bank Park on Saturday. The team was set to work out again on Sunday.
The Phillies have played just three games this season, with series against the Yankees and Blue Jays postponed. Following a two-game set in The Bronx, the Phillies are scheduled to host the Yankees on Wednesday and Thursday.
MLB’s coronavirus crisis grew when the Cardinals had four members of the organization test positive. But the Cardinals, who had their weekend series against the Brewers postponed, are set to resume play Tuesday with a four-game series against Detroit. MLB also got more good coronavirus news with the Marlins reporting no new cases from tests taken Saturday, according to Jon Heyman."
499,Eduardo Rodriguez out for season with post-COVID-19 heart issue,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/eduardo-rodriguez-out-for-season-with-post-covid-19-heart-issue/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Red Sox ace Eduardo Rodriguez will sit out the rest of the season because of a heart issue, which the team believes is related to the southpaw’s recent contraction of COVID-19.
Rodriguez was diagnosed last week with myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart. The 27-year-old tested positive for the novel coronavirus before spring training 2.0, but was cleared to return to team workouts on July 18. Five days later, an MRI revealed Rodriguez’s heart condition, prompting the team to shut him down. Doctors told Rodriguez that up to 20 percent of people who’ve been infected with COVID-19 are diagnosed with myocarditis.
“That’s the most important part of your body, so when you hear that, the first time I hear it I was kind of scared a little,” Rodriguez said. “Now that I know what it is, it’s still scary, but I know exactly what it is. Just talk to my mom, talk to my wife, they know what I have and everything. Now we just gotta take the rest. That’s hard, but you gotta take a rest.”
Despite how much is still unknown about the long-term effects of COVID-19, the Red Sox believe Rodriguez will make a full recovery. Chaim Bloom, Red Sox chief baseball officer, described the complication as “mild” multiple times.
“We are confident that he is going to make a full recovery and that his long-term prognosis is excellent,” Bloom said. “But the fact of the matter is that there just isn’t enough time left this season to safely ramp him back up to pitching…..While the heart is affected like this, we just can’t responsibly put any this kind of cardiovascular load on him. So once it resolves, we’ll be able to progress him back.
“This case, while it’s something that is persistent, is not something that has impacted or damaged the functioning of his heart. Now myocarditis following COVID, it is obviously not something that the medical community has a lot of data on because the virus itself is new, much less in an athlete.”
Rodriguez’s condition serves as a reminder that older and/or immunocompromised individuals are not the only people who should be concerned about contracting the coronavirus.
“You’re more at risk when you’re older, but it hits the young pretty hard, too, at times,” Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said. “And Eddie just, unfortunately, is one of those guys that it hit hard, and to get to lose an entire season, it’s pretty rough on anybody.”
With Chris Sale sidelined by Tommy John surgery, Rodriguez, who went 19-6 with a 3.81 ERA last season, was expected to be the team’s No. 1 starter this season."
500,Pelosi says she has no confidence in White House COVID-19 adviser Dr. Birx,https://nypost.com/2020/08/02/nancy-pelosi-says-she-has-no-confidence-in-dr-deborah-birx/,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday attacked White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx — accusing the physician of helping spread misinformation about the pandemic.
“I think the president has been spreading disinformation about the virus and she is his appointee so, I don’t have confidence there, no,” Pelosi told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday morning when asked if she had confidence in Birx.
The salvo comes after a Politico report on Friday leaked that Pelosi (D. Calif) reportedly chewed out Birx during a meeting with White House officials on Thursday night, calling her “horrible.”
The attacks appear to have been prompted by a New York Times article published last month that offered an unflattering portrayal of Birx as someone eager to provide President Trump with only good news about the pandemic.
Birx, an infectious disease expert who served as the Unites States’ global AIDS coordinator under Presidents Obama and Trump, defended herself shortly after during an appearance on CNN.
“I have tremendous respect for the speaker and I have tremendous respect for her long dedication to the American people and I think it was unfortunate that the New York Times wrote this article without speaking to me,” she said.
The physician, who studied under respected task force expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, also pushed back on the report’s characterization of her as “pollyannaish.”
“I have never been called pollyannaish or non-scientific or non-data driven and I will stake my 40-year career on those fundamental principles of utilizing data to really implement better programs to save more lives,” she continued.
While Fauci has been subjected to months of attacks from members of the Trump administration, Pelosi’s missives against Birx are among the first leveled by a prominent Democrat."

WASHINGTON — President Trump on Sunday criticized the press for failing to cover coronavirus outbreaks in other countries — highlighting a surge of cases in Australia that has forced the city of Melbourne into strict lockdown for six weeks.
“Big China Virus breakouts all over the World, including nations which were thought to have done a great job,” Trump wrote, sharing an alert about a state of disaster being declared in the state of Victoria.
“The Fake News doesn’t report this. USA will be stronger than ever before, and soon!” he added.
Officials Down Under were forced to declare a state of disaster and introduce harsh new measures over the weekend as the state saw a troubling spike in infections, taking the total number of cases to 11,557 with 123 deaths.
An 8 p.m. curfew has been imposed for six weeks and Melbourne residents will only be allowed to leave the house to exercise for an hour once a day or buy groceries. Traveling more than three miles from home is forbidden, according to a report by The Age.
Many of the cases have stumped public health officials, who have so far been unable to identify the source of 760 mystery cases.
Police have been dispatched to help enforce the restrictions, handing out a stunning $250,000 — US $178,400 — in fines in 24 hours over the weekend, the report said.
Australia has almost 18,000 cases in total, and has seen 208 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
So far, 4.7 million Americans have been infected by disease, which has claimed the lives of 147,000 people.
While cases in New York have declined, infections continue to surge in New Jersey, sparking concern that New York could experience a second wave."
502,NY’s largest hospital network had to buy garden hoses to fix ventilators: book,https://nypost.com/2020/08/09/nys-largest-hospital-network-had-to-buy-garden-hoses-to-fix-ventilators/,2020-08-09 00:00:00,"At one point during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, staffers at New York’s largest hospital network were forced to shop at hardware stores for garden hoses to make the ventilators they had received from the state actually work, according to a new book.
This experience and many others resulted in Northwell Health seeking to buy its own medical supply company so it never again has to rely on China or other governments for vital goods like vents, scrubs and masks.
“We should never again have less than a robust stockpile of ventilators and other essential equipment… Overreliance on China to manufacture vital supplies is a perilous gamble,” Northwell Health executive director Michael Dowling writes in “Leading Through a Pandemic.”
“We at Northwell Health are considering acquiring a supply company to achieve a measure of self-sufficiency when it comes to vital supplies.”
The newly-published 187-page book — co-written by Dowling and Northwell’s chief journalist/editor Charles Kenney — is believed to be the first major book written by front-line medical providers who confronted the killer bug’s devastating impact on New York, costing 32,000 lives.
Northwell’s network of 23 hospitals treated some 70,000 coronavirus patients — more than anywhere in the country.
But staffers were plagued by a dire lack of medical equipment, so much so that “Even when we did receive much-needed ventilators from New York State, many arrived without parts needed to make them functional,” execs wrote.
“At one point our staff members went to hardware stores to purchase garden hoses which they cut up and attached so vents would work.”
Northwell’s employees also used 3D-printed parts to help fashion makeshift breathing machines and nasal swabs to test patients for COVID-19, the book says.
The over-reliance on foreign companies extended to pharmaceutical drugs, Northwell officials said, suggesting this was a serious national security issue.
“The United States Army didn’t outsource its bullet making to China,” said Dr. Kevin Tracey, CEO of Northwell’s Feinstein Institute for Medical Research.
The hospital network’s strategy to control its future regarding personal protective equipment is just one takeaway from the book, which explores the lessons it learned during the height of the virus outbreak.
Northwell officials said they have been exploring the possibility since May and that there have been ongoing discussions with private manufacturers.
“We’re in talks with a couple of companies. You can’t depend on people overseas for supplies when you are in the middle of a war,” Dowling told The Post on Sunday.
The tome makes 13 recommendations on how to better prepare for a future disaster — one being that the government should abolish or revise existing rules so medical staffers have more flexibility to respond to public health crises.
Fortunately, Northwell officials said, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and federal health officials had this time waived many of regulations and laws, which exempted doctors and hospitals from medical malpractice suits and making it easier to convert space into COVID-treatment units.
Other proposals include protecting the physical and emotional needs of staff, expanding partnerships with other hospital systems across the country and accelerating the movement for tele-health care.
The book treads lightly on the controversy surrounding the 6,500 COVID-19 deaths in New York nursing homes.
Northwell officials generally call for better safety measures in “congregate settings” such as nursing homes.
“There was too much death in these facilities and we have work to prepare safer congregate environments going forward,” they wrote.
The book also describes how the virus depleted staff. At one point 3,500 workers were quarantined for being infected or exposed to the virus, including more than 20 percent at hard-hit Forest Hills and Valley Stream hospitals.
Northwell said it hired thousands of visiting healthcare professionals and redeployed 2,750 staffers, which included mandatory reassignment, when the worst of the pandemic hit.
The virus also took a financial toll, costing Northwell $1.2 billion in lost revenue and added costs. But the provider said it paid bonuses to front-line workers for their heroic work and said it would worry about the financial reckoning later.
In addition to planning for a future pandemic, the book delves into tales of heroism and hearthbreak from the front lines.
At Lenox Hill Hospital, for example, one nurse played the US Navy band’s version of “The Star Spangled Banner” on her iPhone for relatives of a veteran saying their final goodbyes.
Not everyone was lucky enough to have their family nearby when the moment came.
A worker at Staten Island University Hospital describes in the book how he chose to stay at work instead of making his three-hour trek home to Yonkers just to make sure a patient wouldn’t die alone.
“It’s always going to be with me,” John Baez wrote, “the sadness that she couldn’t have a loved one with her, but I couldn’t let her die alone.”
The book describes how Long Island Jewish Forest Hills was so overwhelmed by the pandemic that 423 COVID patients were transferred to its other hospitals during a four-week period — and 17 people died at the Queens hospital on a single day in March.
“Staff members were shell shocked,” the book states.
In one wrenching episode, a woman with the virus gave birth at LIJ Forest Hills and then died. Her husband succumbed to the virus as well, orphaning their newborn.
“In normal times, that would have been such a tragic story that our teams would have been talking about it and little else for a month,” the book states, “but in the crisis it was just another story.”
“Those on the front lines of the crisis will likely be reckoning with the impact of their experiences, and of the many heartbreaking losses for a long time to come.”"

A’s outfielder Ramon Laureano, who had taken first base after being plunked for the second time in the game, charged the Houston dugout to spark the fight.
Laureano first barked at Astros reliever Humberto Castellanos before engaging in a screaming match with the Astros dugout. Houston bench coach Alex Cintron then appeared to egg on the 26-year-old Laureano, waving for Laureano to approach the Astros road dugout that is unusually located along the first-base line.
“Ramon doesn’t go over there unless something completely offensive came out of that dugout. … That person should get suspended,” A’s manager Bob Melvin told reporters after his team won, 7-2, in Oakland, Calif.

Laureano was quickly wrestled to the ground by backup catcher Dustin Garneau and tensions soared for a few minutes. Laureano and several others weren’t wearing masks; MLB, however, does not require players on the field to wear face coverings aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19.
“I was just trying to stop the situation before punches were really thrown and things got out of hand,” said Garneau, who called Laureano a “good dude.” The two previously played together within the A’s organization.
Laureano was ejected, while Castellanos was later taken out of the game. Astros pitcher Brandon Bailey hit Laureano earlier in the game.
“[Laureano] got hit by two guys who don’t have any time in the big leagues,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said in defending his pitchers. “[Castellanos] wasn’t trying to hit him.”
MLB, as part of its coronavirus protocols that were recently heightened in response to the Marlins and Cardinals’ outbreaks, prohibits teams from engaging in bench-clearing brawls.
The Astros earlier this season were involved in a bench-clearing incident after two of their players were thrown at by Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Joe Kelly, in what many believed was payback for the Houston cheating scandal that was uncovered in the fall.
That confrontation was short-lived and did not include punches being thrown.
Even so, Kelly was suspended eight games during the 60-game season, the equivalent of 22 games during a 162-game season, while Baker and Dodgers skipper Dave Roberts were suspended one game each.
Athletics pitcher and former Astros hurler Mike Fiers in the fall served as the whistleblower in the Astros’ cheating scandal, which involved stealing signs electronically during Houston’s 2017 championship season and parts of 2018.
Fiers was not scheduled to pitch in this series, and he has largely avoided answering questions about the fallout of the scandal, which resulted in MLB suspending Astros manager A.J. Hinch and GM Jeff Luhnow for one year each. Both were subsequently fired by the organization. Alex Cora, a Houston bench coach in 2017, was fired by the Red Sox for his involvement in the scheme, while the Mets fired Carlos Beltran before he even managed a game because of his involvement as a player.
The Astros (6-9) have struggled so far during the abbreviated season and are currently third in the AL West. The Athletics (12-4) are first in the division."

He is accused of attacking the 72-year-old veteran in the lobby of the Red Lion Inn and Suites in Kent, Wash., on July 18. Surveillance video showed a man, later identified as Hansen, approach a partially disabled man sitting in the lobby with his cane and dog nearby.
Hansen allegedly punched the victim several times, rendering him unconscious, before walking away down the hall. Police said the victim suffered a broken jaw in the attack, Q13 Fox reported.
The victim told officers that he has made a remark to Hansen’s girlfriend, who was not wearing a mask or facial covering in the hotel lobby amid the coronavirus pandemic. He said Hansen later came back to the lobby and attacked him.

The 18-karat white gold mask will be decorated with 3,600 white and black diamonds and fitted with top-rated N99 filters at the request of the buyer, said designer Isaac Levy.
Levy, owner of the Yvel company, said the buyer had two other demands: that it be completed by the end of the year, and that it would be the priciest in the world. That last condition, he said, “was the easiest to fulfill.”
He declined to identify the buyer, but said he was a Chinese businessman living in the United States.
The glitzed-up face mask may lend some pizzazz to the protective gear now mandatory in public spaces in many countries. But at 270 grams (over half a pound) — nearly 100 times that of a typical surgical mask — it is not likely to be a practical accessory to wear.
In an interview at his factory near Jerusalem, Levy showed off several pieces of the mask, covered in diamonds. One gold plate had a hole for the filter.
“Money maybe doesn’t buy everything, but if it can buy a very expensive COVID-19 mask and the guy wants to wear it and walk around and get the attention, he should be happy with that,” Levy said.
Such an ostentatious mask might also rub some the wrong way at a time when millions of people around the world are out of work or suffering economically. Levy said that while he would not wear it himself, he was thankful for the opportunity.
“I am happy that this mask gave us enough work for our employees to be able to provide their jobs in very challenging times like these times right now,” he said."

Researchers at Duke University made the discovery while testing 14 different types of masks, according to the study published Friday.
N95 masks, often used by health care professionals, worked best to stop the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech.
Other good performers at stopping leakage were three-layer surgical masks and cotton masks, which can be made at home, the researchers with Duke’s physics department found.
But while bandannas and knitted face coverings may be a unique look, they did not offer much protection, according to the study.
The scientists also discovered that neck fleeces, or neck gaiters, often worn by runners, were the least effective and actually allowed more respiratory droplets to escape than not wearing a mask at all.
That’s because they were shown to break down larger droplets into smaller particles, allowing them to slip out the sides of the covering more easily.
“We were extremely surprised to find that the number of particles measured with the fleece actually exceeded the number of particles measured without wearing any mask,” Martin Fischer, one of the study’s authors, told CNN.
“We want to emphasize that we really encourage people to wear masks, but we want them to wear masks that actually work.”
To test the masks, the scientists made use of a black box outfitted with a laser and a cellphone camera.
Someone wearing a face mask would speak in the direction of the laser beam inside the box. Then the amount of respiratory droplets scattered by the beam were recorded by the camera in the back of the box.
A computer algorithm counted the droplets seen in the video to determine how many had leaked through.
The researchers said this was a low-cost, effective method to test which face coverings worked and which didn’t.
“This is a very powerful visual tool to raise awareness that very simple masks, like these homemade cotton masks, do really well to stop the majority of these respiratory droplets,” Fischer told CNN.
“Companies and manufacturers can set this up and test their mask designs before producing them, which would also be very useful.”"

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday demanded the NYPD do more to enforce social distancing rules — as he announced Queens bars and restaurants had received the bulk of violations a day earlier.
State police and the State Liquor Authority “are continuing to try to fill the vacuum left by local enforcement” in some parts of the state, he told reporters.
Authorities handed out 26 violations to venues a day earlier for breaking coronavirus rules, including 16 in Queens, one in the Bronx, two in Brooklyn, five in Manhattan and two in Nassau County.
“Come on Queens,” the governor chided, adding: “We need the NYPD to step up and help in New York City.”
“We need local governments across the board to also be doing their job.”
Nevertheless, Cuomo said the state had hit its lowest rate of positive coronavirus tests recorded over a one-day period since the start of the pandemic.
The number of people testing positive for COVID-19 was .078 percent Saturday, out of 65,812 people getting tested, Cuomo said — lower than the around 1 percent rate New York had been hovering at.
“It’s great news,” the governor said. “Really incredible achievement by New Yorkers.”
The infection rate is well below the 5 percent threshold recommended by the World Health Organization for general reopening and adopted by the state.
The state also recorded seven fatalities recorded Saturday, bringing the Empire State’s death toll to 25,202.
Cuomo said 548 people are hospitalized with the virus statewide, with 131 in intensive care, “the lowest number we’ve had in ICU since we started,” in March.
Addressing the reopening of schools, Cuomo repeated guidelines he issued on Friday stating that all districts must set dates for three to five virtual discussions with parents before Aug. 21 and also have one separate consultation with teachers alone.
“If the teachers do not agree to come back it’s extremely difficult, if not impossible, to operate school,” the governor said.
“If the parents don’t agree to send their children to school I don’t know how you have school without students.”
The Department of Education is going through reopening plans from the state’s 700 districts, including a supplemental plan submitted by New York City, and will have a status update ready by Monday, Cuomo said."

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday railed against President Trump’s new executive orders for coronavirus relief, saying it’s “laughable” to expect cash-strapped New York to pitch in more money for unemployment.
Trump on Saturday announced a $400 weekly enhanced jobless benefit, reduced from $600, of which the states would have to cover 25 percent, or $100.
“What the president has done has made it impossible, impossible on the state,” Cuomo said during a conference call with reporters.
“The concept of saying to states ‘You pay 25 percent of unemployment insurance’ is just laughable,” Cuomo said.
Covering part of the benefits would set the Empire State back $4 billion, Cuomo estimated, saying the cost was “irreconcilable.”
The orders also don’t solve the issue of getting states aid from the federal government amid the health crisis, the governor said, adding: “You can’t now say to states, who have no funding, ‘You have to pay off the insurance cost.'”
The orders signed by Trump on Saturday — which aim to provide financial relief to Americans suffering amid the pandemic — have been criticized by Democrats as an attempt to bypass Congress.
Cuomo claimed the actions are “on shaky ground legally” and can’t replace another coronavirus relief bill.
“They need legislation,” he said, “it’s the only way to do it.”
In addition to extending the enhanced unemployment benefits that expired at the end of July, the orders create a “payroll tax holiday” until the end of 2020, provide relief for student debt and call for a moratorium on evictions for homeowners with federally backed mortgages.
But Sen. Chuck Schumer on Sunday also attacked the order, saying it still left holes, such as the lack of funding for state and local governments — including to safely reopen schools, and no cash for testing, tracing and treatment of the virus itself.
“The biggest problem with the Executive Orders is not what they do, but what they don’t do,” Schumer said in a press release.
He claimed that the halt on payroll taxes could end up jeopardizing Social Security.
“The president did not ‘cancel’ payroll taxes and this will actually hurt businesses, workers and end up weakening Social Security and Medicare because most employers will continue to withhold the payroll tax so they and their employees won’t be hit with a huge tax bill in December when it expires,” Schumer said.
The New York Democrat urged Republicans and the White House to continue negotiations and come up with a relief bill “that deals with the most critical issues of the public health and economic crisis dealt to us by the coronavirus.”
“I am calling on President Trump and the GOP to meet Democrats in the middle — like we have done in the prior bills — and come up with an agreement that will actually help us get through this crisis,” Schumer said."
509,Steven Mnuchin warns Democrats about challenging Trump’s COVID-19 orders,https://nypost.com/2020/08/09/steven-mnuchin-warns-democrats-about-challenging-trumps-covid-19-orders/,2020-08-09 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday defended the legality of President Trump’s executive orders to provide financial help during the coronavirus — and said Americans would hold Democrats responsible for delaying the assistance if they challenge the actions in court.
“We’ve cleared with the office of legal counsel all these actions,” Mnuchin said on “Fox News Sunday.”
“If the Democrats want to challenge us in court and hold up unemployment benefits to those hardworking Americans that are out of a job because of COVID, they’re going to have a lot of explaining to do,” he added.
White House economic adviser Peter Navarro said the president had to take action to protect Americans after negotiations in Congress ground to a standstill.
“The problem here is Capitol Hill, the swamp, the two Houses that are too far apart. The Lord and the Founding Fathers created executive orders because of partisan bickering and divided government, that’s what we have here,” he said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.”
Some have questioned whether Trump’s executive actions are a means to bypass Congress and its federal spending authority after talks collapsed last week between the White House, Democrats and Republicans.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sidestepped that question during an interview on ABC News’ “This Week.”
“Well, you know, I’ll leave that up to the attorneys. It doesn’t do the job … it’s not going to go into effect in most places for weeks or months because it’s so put together in a crazy way,” the New York Democrat said.
He went on to say that the enhanced unemployment benefits would have continued to “flow smoothly” if the president had extended the $600 supplement that expired at the end of July.
The president extended the benefit but reduced the amount to $400 from $600 a week — with states expected to kick in 25 percent — saying he didn’t want to give the unemployed an incentive not to return to work.
Host Chris Wallace of “Fox News Sunday” pressed Mnuchin on why the administration cut the benefit for the millions of Americans still jobless.
“We thought $400 was a fair compromise, we offered to continue to pay $600 while we negotiate and the Democrats turned that down,” Mnuchin said."

The Cardinals haven’t played a game since July 29, and it’ll be even longer before they hit the field again. St. Louis’ series against the Pirates this week was postponed Sunday, The Post’s Joel Sherman confirmed.
The decision comes after the Cardinals’ three-game series against the Chicago Cubs was postponed this weekend after another two St. Louis players and one staff member tested positive for COVID-19 over the past two days.
This brought the Cardinals’ total positive cases to nine players and seven staffers since last week.
ESPN was the first to report the Cardinals’ latest postponement.
According to The Athletic, the Cardinals were informed Saturday that the team would not be assembling for at least three-to-five days, which indicated the entire series against Pittsburgh could be postponed. Players were told to get in workouts on their own, according to the report.
The 2020 MLB season is just over three weeks old and there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-19 on two teams. More than a dozen members of the Cardinals, including Yadier Molina, have now tested positive over the last week and a half. As many as 20 members of the Miami Marlins, including 18 players, tested positive for the coronavirus since Opening Day on July 23."

For Minnesota Vikings linebacker Cameron Smith, testing positive for COVID-19 turned into a “blessing.”
Smith, a 2019 fifth-round pick (162nd overall), announced Saturday that he will miss the 2020 NFL season because of a congenital heart condition that came to his attention after testing positive for the coronavirus. The 23-year-old will have to undergo open-heart surgery to fix a bicuspid aortic valve, a procedure he didn’t know he needed until he underwent further testing because of his positive test for the virus.
“Although this will unfortunately end my 2020 season, it is really a blessing that we found this as my heart is severely enlarged and wouldn’t have lasted much longer,” Smith wrote in an Instagram post.
He added that he “didn’t think twice” about having the surgery because it will allow him to continue playing football once he’s healed.
“By no means am I ready to be done playing football, there is still so much more I want to accomplish on the field,” Smith wrote. “Im going to attack this like everything else I have in life. Already looking forward to the comeback!”
In the meantime, Minnesota signed former Raiders linebacker Quentin Poling to add depth at linebacker.
A four-year starter at USC, Smith totaled 354 total tackles for the Trojans and earned All-Pac-12 honors in three seasons. Smith played in just five games for the Vikings in his rookie season last year, registering eight tackles."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasted the four executive orders signed by President Trump for financial relief because of the coronavirus pandemic as “unconstitutional slop.”
“No, in fact, what the president did is – I agreed what the Republican senator said – is unconstitutional slop,” Pelosi said during an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” referring to comments made Saturday by GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska.
“While it has the illusion of saying we’re going to have a moratorium on evictions, it says I’m going to ask the folks in charge to study if that’s feasible. While he says he’s going to do the payroll tax, what he’s doing is undermining Social Security and Medicare, so these are illusions,” the California Democrat continued.
The executive orders, criticized as an attempt to bypass Congress, would extend the enhanced unemployment benefits that expired at the end of July, create a “payroll tax holiday” until the end of 2020, provide relief for student debt and continue the moratorium on evictions for homeowners with federally backed mortgages.
Trump said he took the executive actions to protect Americans after weeks of negotiation between the White House, Democrats and Republicans hit a wall.
“Democrats have refused these offers. What they really want is bailout money for Democrat governors and mayors that have been run very very badly for many years,” Trump said.
But Pelosi said she and the Democrats attempted to seek a compromise.
“What the president does doesn’t even accomplish anything he sets out to do in the categories he did, but we said to [Republicans], we’ll come down a trillion [dollars], you come up a trillion [dollars] and we’ll be able to have an agreement that meets the needs of the American people,” Pelosi said.
She said Americans ravaged by the coronavirus are in dire need of help.
“We have to reach an agreement, children are food insecure, families are at the risk of being evicted, the virus is moving like a freight train,” Pelosi said. “The kindest thing I could say he doesn’t know what he’s talking about, or something’s wrong there, something’s very, very wrong.”
Trump signed the executive orders Saturday evening at his New Jersey golf resort."

New Zealand on Sunday marked 100 days since it was able to effectively eliminate the spread of coronavirus.
The South Pacific nation suppressed the spread of the virus by implementing a strict lockdown — that closed the borders to foreign nationals — after only 100 people tested positive in late March.
During the past three months, the only new cases that have cropped up were among returning travelers who were quarantined at the border of the country, which is home to 5 million.
The country has reported just over 1,500 COVID-19 cases and only 22 deaths after the stringent lockdown.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern  announced in early June that they were “confident we have eliminated transmission of the virus in New Zealand for now.”
She has been widely praised for her leadership as other countries look to the nation for answers as they battle the virus.
“It was good science and great political leadership that made the difference,” said epidemiologist Michael Baker, a professor at the University of Otago. “If you look around the globe at countries that have done well, it’s usually that combination.”

Nine people have become infected with coronavirus at the Georgia school where a teen was suspended for recording footage of a crowded hallway in which many students were seen without masks, according to a report.
North Paulding High School in Dallas, Ga., informed parents in a letter Saturday that six students and three faculty members have tested positive for the virus, ABC News reported.
“We have anticipated that COVID-19 would impact us as it has nearly every community, and the district has worked in partnership with the Department of Public Health (DPH) to proactively implement safety precautions and response plans,” they wrote in the letter.
The outbreak comes after Hannah Watters, 15, was suspended last week for posting to Twitter a video of other pupils jam-packed in the hallway during the first week back of classes.
She tweeted on Friday that the school had rescinded her suspension. “This morning my school called and they have deleted my suspension,” she wrote on Twitter."
515,Experts weigh in on how to save New York City post-coronavirus,https://nypost.com/2020/08/16/experts-weigh-in-on-how-to-save-new-york-city-post-coronavirus/,2020-08-16 00:00:00,"New York City is in crisis. Nearly a third of the city is unemployed, according to a New School analysis, businesses are shuttering, residents are fleeing.
Things won’t magically “go back to normal,” at least not without help. Government cannot casually wait for a COVID-19 vaccine while the quality of life plummets. Mayor de Blasio and the City Council must act now, to revitalize Gotham and lay the groundwork for a full recovery.
The Post asked experts what politicians can — must — do to save the city.
E.J. McMahon, senior fellow, Empire Center for Public Policy
With massive budget deficits looming, Mayor de Blasio’s post-pandemic plan boils down to hoping for a stopgap federal bailout and asking Albany for permission to issue billions in deficit bonds.
This won’t solve the problem. New York needed a much leaner, more efficient public sector even before the novel coronavirus blew a hole in its tax base.
De Blasio has added more than 33,000 employees to the city payroll since 2013, the Citizens Budget Commission notes. Cutting even half those positions — bringing city employment back to its 2008 peak under Michael Bloomberg — would save well over $1 billion a year in salary and benefits. Seeking better deals on health insurance and requiring city workers to contribute at least minimally to health insurance and Medicare premiums (like virtually everyone paying their salaries) could save roughly $800 million a year, the Independent Budget Office has estimated.
But municipal unions don’t have a track record of simply volunteering givebacks, even to save jobs. History suggests they will fight tooth and nail to protect everything they have, even in a fiscal crisis.
To win real concessions, the mayor needs leverage — and he can get it from the state Financial Control Board (FCB), created in the mid-1970s to deal with the city fiscal crisis and still in existence as a background watchdog.
The city should adopt a more (justifiably) pessimistic revenue forecast and declare to the FCB that its budget gaps can’t be fully closed without deficit bond financing. The board then will have grounds for asking the Legislature to reinstate a control period and authorize an across-the-board wage freeze.
As the late former Mayor Ed Koch recognized, the FCB can be a mayor’s best friend, by ordering bigger budget cuts than politicians have the nerve to suggest in public.
That might — just might — lead to serious labor bargaining over more palatable alternatives.
This scenario would require a strong partnership between the mayor and the FCB’s chairman, Gov. Cuomo — who until recently showed little interest in the control board. Recently, however, he appointed three close and trusted advisers to the panel. The mayor shouldn’t see this as threat but an opportunity.
Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance
The city must make its public spaces feel safe for everyone — from the residents walking down the street to the tourist hopping on the subway for the first time.
Absent this, the city dies, period.
This will require radical reformations of both policing and public-space management.
Get cops out of cars, quit paramilitary models of management and lengthen neighborhood rotations so that the overwhelming majority of cops who honorably serve the city can build relationships and trust with the residents who overwhelmingly want order and safety.
Create a new Office of Public Space Management — modeled in part on unarmed parks enforcement patrols and interagency special enforcement teams pioneered in Times Square decades ago — to finally take on the incredible complexity of holistically managing streets, sidewalks and plazas in a data-driven, nuanced, thoughtful and compassionate way.
Randy M. Mastro, former deputy mayor of New York City, Chair of Citizens Union, and a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP
We are in a period as challenging as the mid-1930s, and, as such, we need to look to FDR’s New Deal for inspiration.
Central to the New Deal’s success was the Works Progress Administration. Through the WPA, the federal government invested billions of dollars to employ millions of job seekers to carry out public-works projects, including the construction of public buildings, bridges and roads.
We should launch our own version of a modern-day WPA here in New York, committing billions of dollars to expand our city and state’s capital budgets (funded through long-term debt and municipal bonds) to do a major public-infrastructure program, the likes of which we have not seen in New York since the days of Mayor LaGuardia.
There are public buildings to be built, bridges to be reconstructed, roads to be rehabilitated and public-transportation platforms to be upgraded.
There are public-project proposals, like the new Penn Station, that have languished for too many years.
Such a public-works program would serve multiple worthy objectives: getting people back to work in this period of unprecedented unemployment, improving and rehabilitating our long-neglected infrastructure, contributing to our local economy in the near term and doing something very positive for the long-term future of our city and state.
Jay Martin is the executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program (CHIP)
There are a lot of vacant apartments in New York City because of COVID-19, so it may seem odd to some that we are suggesting the building of more housing. But there has never been a better opportunity to increase the number of affordable homes in the city than now.
Before COVID-19 we had a housing affordability crisis because of 50-plus years of government regulation that made it unprofitable to build affordable apartments.
Over time, the situation got worse as property taxes rose dramatically, leading to even higher rents.
Now is the time to flip the switch.
We need to ease some of the oppressive regulations on developing new apartment buildings and fixing up vacant rent-stabilized units.
Provide property-tax relief for buildings that can be passed on to renters.
Encourage development near transit hubs — such as outlined in the YIMBY Act, a bipartisan bill now before Congress and that CHIP supports.
If we don’t build more housing, the existing stock will become continuously obsolete. Luxury apartments will continue to sit empty. Low-income renters will continue to fight to live in overcrowded settings.
The city’s property-tax base, which is the major funder of the social safety net, will decline. And the overall economy will continue to stagnate.
But, if we commit to building more housing, billions of dollars in private equity will flow into the city. Thousands of people will have jobs, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.
And for decades to come, working- class people will be able to afford to live in New York City, paving the way to a brighter future.
Bill Bratton, former NYPD Commissioner
The first obligation of government is public safety — a focus on crime and disorder. We have basically given up on disorder completely in terms of enforcing social norms of behavior, providing fertile ground for the surge in violent crime that we are witnessing.
In NYC, we are experiencing an “Etch-a-Sketch Moment” where many are attempting to erase nearly three decades of the success, progress and reform of the NYPD.
First, we need to hear the protesters, but we also must decide what kind of policing our society is demanding. Would New Yorkers tolerate this level of violence just for a more passive version of policing? Doubtful, particularly in communities of color where recent shooting victims were 97 percent black and Hispanic.
Second, the NYPD’s overtime budget must be restored. You cannot reduce the number of cops by 1,000 and also cut overtime during a major crime wave.
Third, the courts need to clear the backlog of cases due to closures. Only half of the 2,000 people arrested for shootings have been indicted, resulting in hundreds of alleged shooters still on the street.
Fourth, New York’s political leaders rushed to pass too many reforms too quickly where prosecutorial and judicial leniency outweighs concern for victims of crime.
With a few reasonable adjustments, these laws could foster reform without putting police at risk of becoming a “perpetrator” every time a suspect resists arrest.
Fifth, police need to be supported by those they proudly serve and those we elect. Cops need to be reminded of what New Yorkers already believe — that we have trust and confidence in them because they earned it.
The NYPD can move this city forward. They have done it before, but they cannot do it alone. As I often say, we collaborate or perish. If we do not come together, the latter shall be our fate.
Mitchell Moss, Henry Hart Rice Professor of Urban Policy & Planning, Director of Rudin Center for Transportation Policy & Management, New York University
New York City is collapsing. We cannot count on the federal government to save the city — no matter what the mayor dreams. New York City has always been more connected to the globe than to the rest of the nation. In 1609, the Dutch created a trading post in Manhattan to get beaver pelts, used to make felt hats, then popular in Amsterdam. Today, more than 36 percent of the city’s residents are foreign born; more than half of the city’s small businesses are owned by people born in other nations.
Foreign tourists are especially important to our economy since they spend four times more than domestic tourists — even though they account for just 20 percent of all visitors to NYC. The decline in international air travel to the local airports is destroying our city. International flights to New York airports are down by more than 90 percent and the major airlines do not expect international air travel to NYC to recover for at least three years.
The city’s higher-education industry depends on students born in other nations. Currently, more than 40 percent of CUNY students are immigrants. At NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, almost half of the total student body is foreign born.
Richard Ravitch, former Lieutenant Governor of New York
Borrowing money to fix New York’s fiscal crisis adds interest cost to an already unbalanced budget and would mature just when the city is recovering and will need the dollars to rebuild its economy.
The only realistic option is federal grants. The House of Representatives has passed a bill with money to cover revenue shortfalls that cities and states are going through.
Republicans are not yet ready to match the House bill; what New York needs to recover is for the business leaders who have supported President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to organize a major lobbying effort. The city can’t afford to wait till after the election.
Ian Rowe, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute
To bring our metropolis back and create a better future for our children, New York should immediately lift the cap that restricts the ability to open new, innovative public charter schools.
Over the last few months, hundreds of thousands of students experienced major academic losses. Particularly for those who were already behind, the lack of effective remote learning only made things worse. The public-school system should allow new innovations in schooling to flourish.
For example: This spring, a small group of experienced district and charter leaders set out to design, offer and implement an innovative summer remote learning program in collaboration with local education partners across the country. A short eight weeks after launch, 12,000 primarily low-income students in 17 states, including NYC, are engaged in a high-quality five-week summer distance-learning experience.
Award-winning Mentor Teachers, chosen from around the country for their record of outstanding academic results, teach (1:1,000+ students), working alongside partner teachers (1:20+ students) in every locality to provide exceptionally engaging and effective lessons in English, math, science, yoga and dance.
This kind of innovation could be accelerated if the cap on public charter schools were to be lifted. Nearly 50,000 children are on charter wait lists, many of whom live in areas like the South Bronx and Brooklyn, communities hard hit by the pandemic. Give them a shot at a great education. Lift the cap.

In 1978, New York City had 1,504 murders and an 8.9 percent unemployment rate. But the new mayor, Ed Koch, had something else on his mind: dog poop.
“Koch vows stern policy on dogs,” the Times reported. He wanted five separate city departments to go after dog owners for the maximum $100 fine, to “make examples” of scofflaws. In the next few years, Koch would prod the MTA to clean up graffiti.
Koch’s crackdown on New Yorkers who didn’t pick up after their pets was a sign that he knew that in keeping people committed to New York, the little things matter. More than a decade before, he had chaired something called the “Committee to Keep New York City Habitable,” focused on decent sidewalks.
Now, the little things are again driving New Yorkers nuts. Apartmentguide.com notes that noise complaints to 311 have skyrocketed. In May, complaints were up 92 percent, compared to the previous May; June, 79 percent. It’s not just fireworks: People are complaining about parties and loud traffic.
The most complaints came from The Bronx.
It’s good that people are complaining: It means that they haven’t lost faith in the city.
People don’t need one more reason to leave the city, or to give up on assuring quality of life for their families.
A quality-of-life task force should do follow-up interviews with 311 complainers, to see if their problems were resolved. It should also fan out to the hardest-hit neighborhoods during peak complaint hours to assess progress.

Let’s fix the regressive and racist property tax system that taxes higher-value homes at lower rates than less valuable ones. Homeowners in Brownsville pay more than homeowners in Brooklyn Heights.
A fair, more equitable property tax would encourage more housing and likely increase revenue.
These problems will not take care of themselves. We require the boldness and risk-taking that has driven generations of immigrants to succeed and improve our City. The talent, innovation, and will to succeed are already here. What we need is leadership.
Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO, Partnership for New York City
Government bears the responsibility for managing New York’s response to the COVID-19 health crisis and the resulting fiscal challenges facing the city and state. These tasks are daunting and leave little capacity for the public sector to handle the far-reaching economic consequences of the pandemic. To address the complex layers of loss that have plunged the city into Great Depression-era unemployment, we must draw upon nongovernmental sectors for resources and expertise.
Economic recovery requires a dedicated city-state authority responsible for unified direction-setting and coordination of multi-sector investment.
After 9/11, the federal government provided funding for planning and rebuilding through a new state authority, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Its original leadership, appointed by state and local government, was broadly representative of the private and nonprofit sectors and — because it controlled funding decisions — it had meaningful power. It also ensured public input and a transparent decision-making process, which proved essential to restoring confidence after a major disaster.
Today, New York City needs such a dedicated authority to effectively leverage private and federal resources over several years when state and local government will be broke. We need an entity that can bring consistency to recovery efforts and depoliticize the rebuilding process through divisive national and local elections.
Dan Biederman, president, 34th Street Partnership/Bryant Park Management Corp.
I’m usually a wild-eyed optimist about Midtown Manhattan’s fortunes, but not as easily this time.
The combination of COVID-19, brick-and-mortar retail’s decline, the effect of the first looting in Midtown in many decades, the effect of COVID restrictions on the thinly capitalized food and beverage places, the closing of Broadway and the museums, and the travel quarantine rules that keep tourists who would patronize those features out of New York, make a comeback harder to envision.

Opposition parties had sought a delay in the election since an outbreak in Auckland was reported last week, prompting a city lockdown and a halt to campaigning.
“Ultimately I want to ensure we have a well-run election that gives all voters the best chance to receive all the information they need about parties and candidates, and delivers certainty for the future,” Ardern said.
The election, which was scheduled for Sept. 19, will now take place on Oct. 17.
Under New Zealand law, Ardern could have postponed the elections for up to roughly two months. The prime minister said the elections will not be further delayed.
The outbreak in Auckland was reported last Tuesday from a single household in the city. The cluster grew to 49 infections and authorities believe they are all linked.
Before Auckland’s cases, New Zealand went 102 days without reporting a new infection.

Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said her state was “fortunate” not to need the federal funds, citing the rebounding local economy and recent job growth.
“South Dakota’s economy, having never been shut down, has recovered nearly 80 percent of our job losses,” she said in a statement.
“[It] is the only state in the nation that didn’t have extended benefits kick in because our insured unemployment rate has been the lowest in the nation,” Noem added.
The federally enhanced unemployment benefits were included as part of an executive action Trump announced last week. The move came after Congress failed to extend the $600-per-week supplement that expired at the end of July.
The executive action said states would have to pay for 25 percent of $400 weekly unemployment benefits. However, following outcry from cash-strapped states, including New York, the Department of Labor said any $100 already being paid in regular unemployment insurance could count as the match requirement.
Four states — Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and New Mexico — have applied for and been approved for the program, Trump tweeted Saturday.
The governors of Alaska, West Virginia and North Carolina said last week that their states were in as well, CNN reported.
South Dakota appears to be the first state to say it doesn’t need the extra cash.
“My administration is very grateful for the additional flexibility that this effort would have provided,” Noem said in the statement, “but South Dakota is in the fortunate position of not needing to accept it.”

New York City bowling alleys Sunday were preparing to reopen with no time to spare, as the state lifts its coronavirus ban on them Monday.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday that he would allow bowling alleys in the state to reopen after the weekend — sending owners into a joyful panic and players set to strike.
“The phone is ringing off the hook!’’ Mike Rudy, owner of the FunFest NY bowling alley in Mill Basin, Brooklyn, told The Post of customers eager to get reservations for the first time since the state shutdown in mid-March.
He said some players became so desperate for their bowling fix over the past few months that they would call “begging us to sneak in the back door so they can bowl.’’
The new health-safety rules at FunFest include only one group for every two lanes — with them blocked off from surrounding lanes with plastic sheets.
“We [also] will be closing the lanes for 30 minutes between each group that bowls so we can sanitize the balls, clean the buttons and clean the chairs,’’ said Rudy, 65.
“I want people to feel safe. I know if they feel safe and comfortable, they will come back,’’ he said.
“It has been so hard [being closed],’’ the owner said. “We owe over $300,000 to the landlord — and that’s not including taxes.”
Ecstatic FunFest bowler Scott Occhiogrosso, 48, told The Post, “We all just have the gleam back in our eye knowing that it’s going to be open.
“There is something so beautiful about watching someone bowl that is good at it,’’ he said.
“ I love bringing my kids too and watching them fall in love with the game.’’
Bowler Ron Pitts, 56, said, “I feel that it’s absolutely safe to come back and bowl.
“You can bowl with a mask on,’’ he said, noting the state requirement amid the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.
“If I could bowl every single day, I would.’’
Chris Mitchell, CEO of Better Off Bowling, a co-ed social bowling league that joins adults together to play, said, “People are more than eager to get back on the lanes’’ — especially in New York City.
“You can only do so much swiping and Netflix’’ during lockdown, he said.
“People are just really craving this connection and community and fun activities they can do with their friends.
“Nobody wants to be Florida,’’ Mitchell said, referring to that state’s spike in virus cases.
But bowling “is a sport where there is no contact, people aren’t breathing hard, people aren’t sweating.’’
The opening of bowling alleys in New York comes as Cuomo’s office Sunday reported 7 million coronavirus diagnostic tests have now been administered across the state — and that New York marked its ninth consecutive day with a positivity rate below 1 percent.
Museums, other cultural sites and aquariums in the state have been cleared for reopening Aug. 24."

“‘If carefully done, according to the guidelines, there is no reason why you shouldn’t be able to do that (vote at polling place),’ ” the president wrote on Twitter, attributing the quote to Fauci.
The nation’s top infectious disease expert made the statement during a National Geographic event that aired Thursday.
Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, was asked by ABC News’s Deborah Roberts about concerns over heading to the polls amid the viral outbreak.
“Can people safely go out and vote in person, given that this year, there is so much concern around the vote?” Roberts asked.
Fauci replied: “I think if carefully done, according to the guidelines, there’s no reason that I can see why that not be the case.”
However, Fauci said, mitigation measures such as wearing a mask and keeping 6-feet apart should be observed, even at the polls.
“If you go and wear a mask, if you observe the physical distancing, and don’t have a crowded situation, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able to [vote in person],” he said.
But, he warned: “if you’re a person who is compromised physically or otherwise, you don’t want to take the chance.”
And, those not interested in physically going to the polls on Election Day can use mail-in voting if available, Fauci said.
Otherwise, “there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be able to vote in person,” he said."

Exotic dancers weren’t the only ones being exposed in this Canadian strip club.
A Toronto jiggle joint worker infected with COVID-19 may have exposed more than 500 people to the illness, health officials have warned.
The Brass Rail Tavern employee tested positive for the coronavirus just days after the club was allowed to reopen with social distancing measures like mask requirements and social distancing, the Guardian reported.
The employee, who was not identified, worked four shifts between Aug. 4 and Aug. 8, potentially infecting as many as 550 people, according to the Toronto Public Health Department.
Anyone who frequented the spot, which is one of city’s best-known strip clubs, has been asked to monitor themselves for symptoms for 14 days from their visit.
Health officials said the bar has maintained a client log, and has reached out to anyone who left their name and contact information.
But some experts question how successful these contact-tracing efforts can be when it comes to the nudie bar.

Kushner — who shares three children with his wife, first daughter Ivanka Trump — said that he will “absolutely” send them back to school in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”
“Our school’s not opening back up five days a week,” he told the program. “I wish they would, but we absolutely will be sending our kids back to school, and I have no fear in doing so.”
The president’s son-in-law added that he wasn’t concerned about his children being exposed to the virus.
“Children have a six times higher chance to die from the flu than from the coronavirus, so based on the data I’ve seen, I don’t believe that’s a risk,” he said.
Kushner said the president has taken a “very aggressive approach” to tackling the coronavirus pandemic, including promoting social distancing and fast-tracking the search for a cure.
“Most importantly, the president’s really advanced the use of a lot of therapeutics, which is bringing the case fatality rate down better, which has been a good thing and obviously fast-tracking a vaccine” Kushner said."

There have been 23 cases detected at the Pi Beta Phi chapter, an off-campus sorority house, according to the university on Saturday.
“Due to the nature of this situation, the entire chapter house is in isolation or quarantine and will be prohibited from leaving the facility,” the college said.
“One member of the sorority who lives elsewhere is among those who tested positive and will also remain in isolation.”
The chapter house has already been disinfected and will be again after the two-week quarantine period, officials said.
Some students, however, said they fear the outbreak will spread even further on campus.
“You have girls that live in-house and some that don’t live in house,” student Julia Aguirre told News9. “I mean, they’re coming in and out, in and out all day.”
Greek Life has been behind virus outbreaks at other schools, including the University of Washington, where at least 93 students were sickened with the illness. Eighty-nine of the infected students lived in the college’s off-campus frat houses.

523,"New York has administered seven million COVID-19 tests, Gov. Cuomo says",https://nypost.com/2020/08/16/new-york-has-administered-7-million-covid-19-tests-cuomo/,2020-08-16 00:00:00,"Seven million coronavirus diagnostic tests have now been administered across New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday, as the state marked a ninth consecutive day with a positivity rate below 1 percent.
“Our numbers reflect the hard work of New Yorkers, and as other states across the nation see surging cases, our numbers remain steadily low,” said Cuomo in a statement.
That success includes a 0.78 percent positivity rate among the 77,692 test results returned on Saturday, a ninth straight day below the 1-percent mark.
The positivity rate in New York City was slightly higher than the state average, at 0.9 percent.
Nevertheless, Cuomo said the raw testing numbers and steadily low number of new diagnoses “are remarkable accomplishments that New Yorkers should be proud of.”
The 607 new cases detected on Saturday raises the overall number of diagnoses throughout the pandemic to 425,508.
And while the big-picture numbers continue to trend in the right direction, another six New Yorkers lost their battle to the bug on Saturday, raising the statewide death toll to 25,250.
“We must not become complacent and risk slipping backwards,” said Cuomo. “Everyone must remember to wear their masks, socially distance, wash their hands regularly, and stay New York Tough.”
To that end, state authorities paid visits to 1,170 restaurants and bars across the five boroughs plus Long Island on Saturday to ensure that they were abiding by rules put in place to vanquish the virus.
Thirty-three joints were found to be flouting regulations and issued violations: Nine in Manhattan; eight a piece in Brooklyn and Nassau County; five in The Bronx; and three in Queens."
524,Formerly homeless Marine vet-turned-nurse gives back amid pandemic,https://nypost.com/2020/08/23/formerly-homeless-marine-vet-turned-nurse-gives-back-amid-pandemic/,2020-08-23 00:00:00,"A US Marine veteran who went from living on the streets to becoming an ER nurse at a Long Island hospital found inspiration to help the homeless in the coronavirus pandemic.
Antranik “Andy” Garabedian, 41, used his experience to start a charity for the homeless as he watched the virus take its toll on people on the street — and said he’s handed out close to 1,500 meals across the five boroughs and Nassau County, Long Island since April.
“I always said I was going to do something to help people that needed more help than me,” Garabedian told The Post. “I just didn’t know it was going to take a pandemic.”
The Long Island native knows first-hand about homelessness: He spent about three years on the streets in the early 2000s after receiving a medical discharge from the Marines.
Garabedian still adhered to the Marine Corps.’ values of “adapt, improvise, overcome” as he struggled to make his own way. He would even volunteer at food pantries and soup kitchens — without admitting he needed help himself.
“I could go there to steal food, and nobody would know I was in need,’’ he said. “Embarrassment was probably the largest thing … admitting that I wasn’t OK.”
Eventually, Garabedian said, he knew he couldn’t keep on living the way he was.
“I was at my wits’ end,” he said. The worst part “was knowing that I didn’t really exist.”
“I’d walk on the street telling myself, ‘There’s got to be more than this.’ It got overwhelming. I didn’t want to be homeless.”
New Year’s Eve 2007 was cold and dreary on the streets of Smithtown, LI, and Garabedian said he contemplated ending his life that night.
Then he happened to stop by the rectory of the local Catholic church, St. Patrick’s.
The man who answered the door “could tell that I was at the end of my rope, and he invited me inside,’’ Garabedian said.
A nun there gave him a grilled-cheese sandwich and a glass of milk, and the priest offered him a cot for the night.
Their kindness prompted Garabedian to figure out a way to apply to Suffolk County Community College and get back on his feet. He found his passion in nursing.
At the height of New York’s coronavirus outbreak this past spring, Long Island Jewish Valley Stream was getting “slaughtered,” said Garabedian, a nurse there.
“We were so inundated. You didn’t even have a chance to breathe.”
In one day, the Northwell Health hospital’s emergency room saw 200 people, though it was built to handle a maximum of 60, he recalled. Garabedian said he once lost 10 patients in a 24-hour span.
At least 40 of the COVID-19 patients he treated were homeless.
They told him life on the streets was made rougher by the virus, with no panhandling, few food scraps to take out of the trash and less room at shelters and soup kitchens. He asked what they planned to do, and they told him, “Try not to die,” he said.
“It was weighing on me,” Garabedian said. “I knew exactly what they were going through.”
After a spur-of-the-moment visit to Midtown, where Garabedian gave out protein bars, socks and other items he had in his car to a group of homeless people, he decided to give back on a larger scale.
He asked co-workers for help — and they donated $4,000 in just one week.
“People started to realize that we’ve become so desensitized to what goes on around us, a lot of us feel very hopeless, that this is a way to get redemption,” Garabedian said.
“This is about trying to give people a sense of community, making them feel like they belong.”
The healthcare hero used the cash to buy sandwiches and meals from local restaurants — supporting them amid the pandemic, too — and then donated the food to the homeless. He supplemented the packages with items bought with his own money.
“Putting myself out there makes me feel doubly good,” Garabedian said.
With the help of another nurse, Dawna Scheich, and the support of the hospital’s administration, he was able to register his charity — Aggregate Hearts. He now works five days a week as a nurse and spends one day on prep for the charity and one day on making deliveries.
Still, the do-gooder does need some help himself — such as with building a website — and is no longer embarrassed to admit it.
“It’s not just about me,” he said, “It’s about all of us making a sacrifice.”"

“This is a serious outbreak in Danbury and we really need an all hands on deck approach,” Acting DPH Commissioner Deidre S. Gifford said in a statement.
From Aug. 2 to 20, the city recorded 178 new cases of the virus, compared to 40 over the previous two weeks.
Health officials are blaming the outbreak on outdoor barbecues, travel and youth sports, which have been canceled over the uptick.
Danbury residents should also avoid unnecessary gatherings, church services and limit other indoor activities, officials said.
Those who feel they have been exposed to the illness are urged to self-quarantine for 14 days.

And the possibility exists of a very busy week ahead for the Mets, who could play as many as three doubleheaders by the end of next weekend.
Yankees manager Aaron Boone said the teams could play one or two doubleheaders during the next scheduled Subway Series in The Bronx, which would begin Friday. And Marlins president Michael Hill said he expected his team to face the Mets beginning Tuesday, with the chance of a doubleheader Thursday, since the upcoming series is the last time the two teams are slated to meet during the regular season.
“They’re on our schedule to open up Tuesday night, so we’re expecting that we have a three-game series with the Mets until we hear otherwise,’’ Hill told reporters Sunday in Miami. “But the expectation also would be that at some point, given the fact that this is the last series of the year versus the Mets, that we are planning to make up that lost game.”

The Marlins have already been severely impacted by their own coronavirus outbreak, when their season was paused. And the Yankees had a series against the Phillies postponed earlier in the season, although they were able to pivot and play Baltimore instead.
A statement Saturday night released by the Mets said two rounds of COVID-19 tests taken by the traveling party from New York to Miami late in the week had all returned negative. In addition, tests for all close contacts that remained in Miami were negative.
The tests on the traveling party were conducted Thursday night and Friday morning at Citi Field, after a position player and coach tested positive for the coronavirus in Miami, which caused four straight days of postponements. The player and coach who tested positive remained in quarantine in Miami.
There remains no plan for the Mets and Yankees to play on Monday’s mutual off day. The teams have mutual days off on Sept. 3 and 14.
The Mets have not been allowed to use Citi Field this weekend. They last played on Wednesday in Miami, when they beat the Marlins. A day later, the Mets were notified about an hour before the scheduled first pitch of the positive test results.
Before the unscheduled break, the Mets had started to break out of their offensive slump. They won three straight games in Miami and were headed home to face an injury-riddled Yankees team. But the postponements also allowed them to realign a pitching rotation that was in disarray."
527,Giants manage to avoid NFL’s coronavirus testing mess,https://nypost.com/2020/08/23/giants-manage-to-avoid-nfls-coronavirus-testing-mess/,2020-08-23 00:00:00,"No Giants players received a false positive COVID-19 test even though the team uses the same New Jersey-based processing lab responsible for a rash of misdiagnosed results around the NFL this weekend, according to a league source.
The entire Giants roster was on the practice field at 1 p.m. Sunday. The only members of the organization affected were staffers told to stay home, as first reported by Sports Illustrated.
“We have a trailer in our parking lot where everyone in our organization gets tested on a daily basis,” coach Joe Judge said. “There is a survey you fill out first relating to any symptoms, then you go through the nose swab and the temperature check. Then they let you in. You go about your day. You get the results later on.”
What if this happened on a regular-season weekend?
“We put down a contingency plan for if any coach or staff member wasn’t available on a daily basis,” Judge said. “It’s not just if one person is missing. What if multiple people are missing? Who handles each responsibility?
“We’re going beyond the coaching staff right now to keep a lot of different people in the organization involved so that, if it was ever an emergency situation, we have people who are up to date schematically and conceptually on what we are doing football-wise to have as many hands on deck available for us.”
The reinforcements include strength coaches, quality control coaches, analytics interns and more.
“These are people involved in our meetings every day,” Judge said. “As far as I’m concerned, if you are in a meeting, you better learn the material. If you know the material, you better have a voice when it’s asked. That’s what an emergency would be — when you have to go outside the framework of your immediate coaching staff.”"
528,Big East athletic directors mull college basketball bubble ideas,https://nypost.com/2020/08/23/big-east-athletic-directors-mull-college-basketball-bubble-ideas/,2020-08-23 00:00:00,"Every week since the novel coronavirus pandemic hit in March, canceling most of the Big East Tournament and the entire NCAA Tournament, the league’s athletic directors have met virtually. And as the fall nears, and the college basketball season gets closer, they have begun talking about the possibility of a bubble for men’s and women’s basketball to safely play a conference season.
“We definitely talk about it. There’s been discussions in every meeting since June about different concepts and over the last two-to-three weeks we’ve had presentations of some early ideas from the league office, how [a bubble] could look,” St. John’s athletic director Mike Cragg told The Post. “I’m not in favor of a three-month bubble or the whole season. That’s not practical. I am interested in short bursts of a bubble. If you can create a two- or three-week bubble and play six or eight games, I think that makes a lot of sense.”
A bubble has worked well for the NBA and NHL, but as Cragg eluded to, the Big East isn’t interested in a bubble for multiple months. The discussions have centered on bubbles a few weeks at a time, sources said, though the basketball-centric league is still focused on a number of different options, from starting the season on time without fans to it being moved back to January. NCAA senior VP of basketball Dan Gavitt said last week a decision will be made by mid-September on whether the season and practice will start on time. NCAA president Mark Emmert, Gavit and Kentucky athletic director Mitch Barnhart, who is also the chairman of the selection committee, have all said publicly that a bubble model could be used for an altered championship structure, a sign that leagues would be encouraged to play conference seasons in a similar vein. It’s clear how important the sport is to the conference and that’s why so many different possibilities are on the table.
“At this stage, our job is to come up with as many ways as could be possible [to have a season],” Cragg said.
There is, of course, a lot that would be needed to happen for a bubble to be created. For one, it would have to be affordable. All the schools are either going to virtual learning or a hybrid approach, so players wouldn’t miss classes. And the TV partner, Fox, would have to be on board. At that point, the league’s presidents could be given the parameters of the plan and hold a vote.
“It takes a lot of things. It’s not just, ‘Here’s 13 guys, here’s another 13 guys, let’s go play a game,’ ” Cragg said. “It’s an investment.”
The league has discussed a number of options relating to a bubble, such as including men’s and women’s basketball in one bubble with all 22 teams, two separate bubbles broken down by two regions and separating men’s and women’s basketball, sources said. Fox has been approached to gauge its interest. The idea of a bubble has received “very strong” support, one source said, though it will ultimately come down to what the league’s presidents decide.
One location that has been discussed is Omaha, Neb., with Creighton serving as the host because of its ample facilities that included two on-campus practice facilities, two large hotels located right next to the team’s arena, the CHI Health Center, that is attached to a convention center that could be used for additional practice courts.
“If the season was to start tomorrow, [a bubble] is the only way we could do it,” Cragg said. “I’m in favor of trying to figure it out, if that’s the only way we can play with less risk.”"

President Trump on Sunday announced an emergency authorization for convalescent plasma to be used as a coronavirus treatment, dubbing it a “truly historic” declaration.
The designation by the Food and Drug Administration will make it easier for some COVID-19 patients to obtain the treatment — which utilizes the antibody-rich blood plasma of those who have recovered from the virus — as clinical trials and studies continue.
“I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives,” Trump said at a press conference with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and FDA Director Stephen Hahn.
“Today’s action will dramatically expand access to this treatment.”
Sunday’s announcement comes after the FDA last week halted an emergency approval for the approach to allow for more data to be reviewed.
This prompted Trump to accuse the agency of deliberately slow-walking coronavirus treatments and therapeutics before the November election.
Hahn said Sunday that the treatment is “safe and shows promising efficacy.”
It’s not clear whether the FDA has received any additional data from clinical trials in the last week.
The new action is based primarily on preliminary data from a Mayo Clinic-led study that was part of an “expanded-access program” sponsored by the FDA to speed up access to experimental therapy.
More than 70,000 coronavirus patients in the US have been treated with blood plasma. Preliminary data from 35,000 of them found there were fewer deaths among those given the treatment within the first three days of diagnosis and also among those given plasma with the highest levels of virus-fighting antibodies.
“If you donate plasma you could save a life,” Azar said Sunday.
In a letter describing the emergency authorization, the chief scientist for the FDA, Denise Hinton, noted: “COVID-19 convalescent plasma should not be considered a new standard of care for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.”
“Additional data will be forthcoming from other analyses and ongoing, well-controlled clinical trials in the coming months.”
On Sunday, Hahn said FDA staffers were working day and night to “cut through red tape” when it comes to coronavirus treatments and therapeutics, at the president’s behest.
Just one other drug, remdesivir, so far has been approved for emergency use by the agency.

530,NJ gym that defied order to close is now campaign HQ for GOP hopeful,https://nypost.com/2020/08/23/nj-gym-that-defied-order-to-close-is-now-campaign-hqs-for-gop-hopeful/,2020-08-23 00:00:00,"The owners of a New Jersey gym that famously defied Gov. Phil Murphy’s order to remain closed amid the coronavirus, only to be arrested, say they are reopening as a campaign headquarters for a GOP candidate.
“We took a stand for our constitutional rights and for the rights of all small business owners throughout the country,’’ Ian Smith, co-owner of the Atilis Gym in Bellmawr, told “Fox & Friends Weekend’’ on Sunday of the establishment’s repeated attempts to stay open for business in violation of state virus restrictions.
“And it wasn’t intended to become political,” Smith said of the gym’s defiance. “We were trying to offer a solution to a problem where the government was failing, and it turned political.
“And that was because of Gov. Murphy’s actions. So now we made it political just as much as he has.”
The gym will serve as a campaign headquarters and rally spot for Republican US Senate candidate Rik Mehta, a pharmacist who is challenging Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), the owners said.
Gym co-owner Frank Trumbetti, asked whether the pair thought the state might try to mess with them this time around, responded, “We believe they can’t. It doesn’t mean that they’re not going to.
“We hope it gives us a reprieve until Nov. 3,” he said of potential government interference at the gym. “Everyone who comes in here will be a volunteer for the Mehta campaign, and we’ll be here to exercise our rights.”
“And we’re not requiring masks, either,” Trumbetti added defiantly.
The state requires masks at establishments indoors if social-distancing is not an option.
The governor’s office Sunday referred questions about the gym to the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office, which did not respond to a Post request for comment.
Fewer than two weeks ago, figures showed that New Jersey ranked the worst in the country in terms of COVID-19 deaths per million residents, with 15,966 fatalities from the virus. But with its infection and mortality rate dropping, some residents and business owners still hampered by health restrictions are calling for the regulations to be loosened.
“We’re really tired of this one-sided control that the governor has,” Mehta told Fox. “We’ve asked many times … Where’s the science? … We flattened the curve, and they keep moving the goalpost.”"
531,Here’s what is driving Italy’s surge in COVID-19 cases,https://nypost.com/2020/08/23/vacationers-migrants-drive-italys-surge-in-covid-19-cases/,2020-08-23 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Sicily’s governor has ordered all migrant residences on the Italian island to be shut down by Monday, part of a push-back by Italian regions alarmed by a surge in COVID-19 cases a few weeks before schools are to reopen.
But while some new migrants have tested positive, vacationers returning from Mediterranean Sea resorts abroad as well from the Italian island of Sardinia lately have accounted for far more of Italy’s new coronavirus infections.
On Saturday, Italy registered 1,071 new cases, the highest daily number since mid-May and only weeks after the nation had seen the number of day-to-day new infections plunge to about 200.
The Lazio region, which includes Rome, surpassed hard-hit Lombardy on Saturday for the highest daily new caseload, as returning travelers got tested at Rome-area airports and a port north of the Italian capital.
On the mainland, most of the latest cases were linked to travelers coming from abroad. Those arriving from Spain, Malta, Greece and Croatia must be tested within 48 hours of entering Italy, after those places started experiencing worrisome upticks in coronavirus infections.
And many recent coronavirus clusters have been traced to people who vacationed on Sardinia. With many people taking ferries from Sardinia to the Italian mainland, Lazio set up a testing facility at Civitavecchia’s dock, so those driving vehicles off the boats could line up for immediate testing.
Lazio Gov. Nicola Zingaretti appealed to the governor of Sardinia to test vacationers before they sail or fly from the island to the mainland, saying his region would do the same for travelers leaving for Sardinia.
In Sicily, Gov. Nello Musumeci’s ordinance took effect on Sunday, requiring all migrants who reach the island by sea be transferred off as part of measures to combat the spread of COVID-19.
It stipulates that all centers housing migrants awaiting processing of asylum applications be shut down by the end of Monday. His order, effective through Sept. 10, also forbids any boat, including charity vessels, to bring migrants to the island.
But the national government, not regional governors, are in charge of migrant policies and Musumeci acknowledged that his directive might be challenged in court.
On Saturday, migrants accounted for 16 of Sicily’s 48 confirmed infections.
Although in past years, nearly all migrants reaching Italy by sea were rescued by humanitarian groups, cargo ships or military vessels, this year, nearly 80% of arrivals reached Italian shores on their own, most setting sail from Tunisia.
Many come ashore on tiny Lampedusa island, whose migrant residence is dangerously overcrowded. Italy has taken to quarantining the latest arrivals aboard chartered ferries offshore Sicily.
“I can’t ask our people to keep a (safe) distance, wear masks and do other measures while the state amasses people in two rooms,” Musumeci said, referring to the migrant centers.
Gov. Vincenzo De Luca, who leads the Campania region including Naples, raised the possibility that if the daily infections numbers become “alarming, we’ll ask the government to bring back the limits” on traveling between regions that were in force through much of Italy’s lockdown.
Some wrote off De Luca’s warning as posturing before gubernatorial elections in several regions, including his own, in September.
“What is he going to do, send in the Carabinieri (to block those outside his region from entering)?” Tuscany Gov. Enrico Rossi told the Corriere della Sera newspaper."
532,NFL’s first coronavirus testing hiccup affects multiple teams,https://nypost.com/2020/08/23/nfls-first-coronavirus-testing-hiccup-affects-multiple-teams/,2020-08-23 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The NFL hit its first snag in coronavirus testing. Fortunately, the end result was more negative COVID-19 testing.
Saturday’s round of testing in the NFL produced a significant increase in positive tests, but it appears most, if not all of them, were false positives from the same laboratory in New Jersey.
Even so, it raised a major issue: What if this was a Sunday in September? Any player who tests positive must have two negative tests before returning to practice, even if the positive test is found to be false.
“My question immediately would be, if you realize it’s a lab issue, would a point-of-care test on the game site — if it was negative — would that allow the player to play?” Bills general manager Brandon Beane said. “And I don’t have that answer, but that’s the question that we’ll have to see how the league would respond to that.
“[It’s] probably better that this happened now than three weeks from now.”
Beane said at least 10 teams were impacted by inconsistent testing on Sunday. The Jets had 10 false-positive tests and the Giants had staff members test positive. The Bears had nine players/staff members test positive, but later confirmed all of those to be false positives. They moved practice back from the morning until 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.
The Browns initially canceled their Sunday practice out of caution after they had several positive test results and closed their practice facility while it underwent a deep cleaning and disinfectant process. But later in the day, they reopened the facility and held practice, since the players, coaches and staff members who tested positive received a negative test on Sunday, “which is consistent with the irregularities across the league from multiple teams,” the Browns said in a statement.
The Bills also moved their Sunday workout back while needing to hold out some players, while the Steelers had six players miss practice Saturday to adhere to protocol, but all were back in team meetings on Sunday. The Vikings had eight players, one coach and three staff members with apparent false-positive tests, coach Mike Zimmer said, and none of them were able to practice on Sunday. Quarterback Josh Allen was one of six Bills players who received a false positive, according to ESPN, forcing him out of Sunday’s practice. The Patriots, Lions and Packers were also impacted at a lesser extent.
“Saturday’s daily COVID testing returned several positive tests from each of the clubs serviced by the same laboratory in New Jersey,” the NFL said in a statement. “We are working with our testing partner, BioReference, to investigate these results, while the clubs work to confirm or rule out the positive tests. Clubs are taking immediate precautionary measures as outlined in the NFL-NFLPA’s health and safety protocols to include contact tracing, isolation of individuals and temporarily adjusting the schedule, where appropriate. The other laboratories used for NFL testing have not had similar results.”"

The victims were crushed to death or asphyxiated when around 120 people tried to escape the Thomas Restobar club Saturday night through the only entrance door, national police and government officials said.
There were also at least six people injured, including three officers, as clubgoers became trapped between the door and a staircase leading to the street.
“In these circumstances when people begin to fight to get out, it’s tumultuous, everyone goes against each other,” Orlando Velasco of the National Police told local radio station RPP.
Peru shuttered nightclubs and bars in March and then banned extended family gatherings Aug. 12, as the country grapples with the second-highest coronavirus infection rate in Latin America.
The country has recorded 585,236 confirmed infections as of Saturday, doubling the number on July 2, according to a tally from Reuters.

The White House is touting a “breakthrough” on a coronavirus therapeutic that President Trump will announce in a news conference Sunday evening.
“News conference with President @realDonaldTrump at 6 pm tomorrow concerning a major therapeutic breakthrough on the China Virus. Secretary Azar and Dr. Hahn will be in attendance,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany posted on Twitter late Saturday night.
Trump on Sunday changed the time to “5:30 sharp” on Twitter and previewed “very good news.”
The White House moments later confirmed the time change and updated the president’s schedule.
Trump will make the announcement alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and the director of the Food and Drug Administration Stephen Hahn.
Earlier Saturday, Trump accused the FDA of delaying possible coronavirus treatments to disrupt his re-election campaign.
“The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!,” Trump tweeted.
The FDA last week stopped an emergency approval for blood plasma as a treatment for the disease.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump’s comments “very dangerous.”
“The FDA has a responsibility to approve drugs, judging on their safety and their efficacy, not by a declaration from the White House about speed and politicizing the FDA,” Pelosi during a news conference Saturday on Capitol Hill.
“This was a very dangerous statement on the part of the president. Even for him, it went beyond the pale in terms of how he would jeopardize the health and well-being of the American people,” she continued.
In another Tweet on Saturday, Trump said “many doctors and studies disagree” with the FDA “revoking emergency use authorization” of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven anti-malarial drug the president has pitched as a possible coronavirus treatment."

White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx on Sunday said that while she’s “hopeful” for a  vaccine, she’s also convinced that the spread of COVID-19 can be stopped through mask-wearing and social distancing.
Speaking at an event in Minnesota, Birx urged Americans to “do the right thing” now, so there are fewer cases of the virus in the fall, CNN reported.
“Yes, I’m hopeful for a vaccine,” Birx said, “but I’m also very convinced right now that we can stop community spread by wearing masks, socially distancing and avoiding crowds.”
The physician pointed out that crowds aren’t limited to events such as concerts, but also backyard barbecues with 25 people who aren’t wearing masks.
Scientists and health experts have voiced concerns that President Trump might apply pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve a vaccine before November to increase his chances of winning another term.
Large-scale clinical trials of the leading vaccine candidates from Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, were launched in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson said it hoped to include 60,000 subjects in its Phase 3 trial, according to Reuters.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, another White House coronavirus expert, has warned against fast-tracking a vaccine through an emergency use authorization before it is proven safe in large trials.
“One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enroll people in their trial,” Fauci told Reuters last week."
536,Hundreds of South Carolina college students busted at massive pool party,https://nypost.com/2020/08/30/south-carolina-college-students-busted-for-pool-party/,2020-08-30 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Hundreds of raucous party-goers crammed into a pool area near the University of South Carolina over the weekend in violation of coronavirus rules, authorities said.
The Columbia Fire Department said it broke up the massive bash around 6 p.m. Saturday after receiving calls from concerned neighbors, The State reported.
“It was almost like Mardi Gras,” Fire Chief Aubrey Jenkins told the newspaper.
The pool at The Apartments at Palmetto Compress was packed with revelers, who also crowded the side of the swimming area and even stood on top of the pool house, the fire chief said.
No one was practicing social distancing or wearing a mask, Jenkins said, “but there was lots of drinking going on.”
Even without the raging pandemic, “there still would have been too many people in the pool,” Jenkins said.
When officials ordered the party-goers to scram, the chief said, he was shocked that one person told him, “I can’t catch COVID. I’m immune to the stuff.”
The pool area at the apartment complex — which advertises as being “just steps from the University of South Carolina” — was shuttered until fire officials can verify its capacity.
Jenkins said he would recommend keeping the pool shut for the foreseeable future as a safety precaution during the virus outbreak.
The revelers were let off with a warning, and no fines were issued. Not wearing a mask is a civil infraction punishable by a fine of up to $25 in the city of Columbia.
USC said it was glad that authorities had busted the pool party.
“We’ve done a lot of outreach to try and get the students to do the right thing,” spokesman Jeff Stensland told the newspaper. “Just because a pool is there, you don’t have to swim in it.”
In the week since USC’s fall semester started on Aug. 20, at least 620 students have tested positive for COVID-19, the university said.
Six sorority houses in the school’s Greek Village were quarantined after several people in each house were infected with the virus, according to The State."

Gaga grabbed the spotlight, as only she can, alongside her “Rain on Me” collaborator during a performance of their single from Gaga’s dance-centric “Chromatica,” which was one of the most anticipated albums of the summer.
The song went on to win VMAs for Song of the Year, Best Collaboration and Best Cinematography. 
Sporting a high-tech face mask, lots of leather and a splash of purple, Artist of the Year Lady Gaga did a quick-hit of her song “911” before segueing into an energetic rendition of “Rain on Me” with Grande, who wore a matching purple ensemble. Gaga then implored viewers to “every night celebrate yourself . . . mask up . . . be kind, be brave” before launching into her single “Stupid Love.”
The dancing duo, who this year tied for the most nominations at nine each, joined an A-list virtual lineup of performers including The Weeknd, BTS, Doja Cat, wrecking-ball fan Miley Cyrus and Maluma. However, singers Roddy Ricch and J Balvin — who had been on tap to perform — pulled out of the show for unknown reasons on Aug. 21.
Grande, 27, has previously performed five times at the VMAs. Her most recent visit was in 2018, when she joined dozens of dancing women at a long table — an apparent homage to Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” — for a sultry version of “God Is a Woman,” from her album “Sweetener.” In 2016 she memorably joined up with Nicki Minaj for a neon-lit workout to their collaboration “Side to Side.” Far less theatrical was her first appearance, in 2013, when the understated newbie performed “Baby I” and “The Way” outdoors with a faux Brooklyn Bridge as her backdrop.
The 34-year-old Gaga is, of course, known for getting attention on the VMA stage. She last hit the show in 2013, when she opened  with a string of wig- and costume-changes during a performance of “Applause,” the debut single from her third album, “Artpop.” And before that, in 2011, the “Born This Way” singer dressed as a slick-haired, sideburned and chain-smoking male alter-ego, Jo Calderone, to kick off the event. Before launching into the downtempo “You and I,” she gave a rambling monologue dissing herself — “She’s f–king crazy!” she yelled into the mic at one point — as stunned audience members including Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and Katie Holmes looked on.
Then there was 2010, when Gaga didn’t actually perform but her multiple costume changes included the infamous meat dress that she wore to accept the video of the year award for “Bad Romance” from another famously outrageous dresser, Cher. (Gaga won eight Moon Person awards on 13 nominations that year.)
Perhaps that iconic appearance was foreshadowed by her wild VMAs debut in 2009, when she performed a mashup of “Poker Face” and “Paparazzi” — off of her first album “The Fame” — that ended with pretending to hang her bloodied self onstage, an allusion to being killed by fame.
She’s clearly alive and kicking — and still famous."

Dozens of emergency first-responders and others who were stricken with underlying illnesses linked to their work around Ground Zero have succumbed to the pandemic, a top victims’ lawyer told The Post.
“It’s a perfect storm,’’ said Michael Barasch, whose law firm represents thousands of 9/11 survivors, responders and victims’ kin enrolled with the Sept. 11 Victims Compensation Fund.
“The most common 9/11 illness was respiratory disease,” Barasch said. “Your immune system is shot.
“COVID attacks everyone, but the most vulnerable are those with respiratory illness who can’t fight the virus. … It shouldn’t surprise us that so many in the 9/11 community are getting COVID and are unable to fight it.
“It’s heartbreaking.”
The lawyer with Barasch McGarry said 98 of his clients who recently died either contracted or are suspected of having gotten COVID-19 and that t killed them.
He said he expects the virus death toll among his clients to rise, too, making this year’s somber 19th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on Manhattan’s World Trade Center even more grief-filled.
People in the 9/11 community are scared because they can’t fight it off. They are literally scared to death,” he said of the virus.
According to Barasch, those with 9/11-related illnesses who died from COVID-19 include Michael Hankins, 69, a retired marshal from the Addisleigh section of Queens who was diagnosed with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and died from the coronavirus April 2.
Hankins responded to Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks and spent weeks at a makeshift morgue near there documenting evidence, such as recovery of body parts or other material, to help identify the dead.
During that time, he met his future wife, Victoria Burton, a retired police detective, who also performed the same gruesome task for the NYPD.
Burton told The Post that her husband’s health “went south very quickly’’ after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.
Before then, he had been healthy enough to referee sporting events, she said.
Burton said 2020 was going to be the year for the couple to travel together.
“You make plans, but nothing is guaranteed,” she said sadly.
Arthur Lacker, 72, a driver for a construction company spent two and a half years helping clear debris from Ground Zero, only to develop lung cancer and asthma and then die of COVID-19 on April 22.
“Artie was a young 72,” said his wife, Robin Lacker, noting he was still working before contracting the virus.
She said she could not see her husband after he was hospitalized with COVID, given the ban on visitation during the peak of the pandemic.
“The only time I saw him was on a Facebook  chat to say goodbye,’’ she said.
“What Artie went through was horrendous,’’ Lacker said — as she urged New Yorkers to “be respectful of other people. Wear a mask’’ amid the virus.
And Beatrice Granberg, 79, worked as an administrative aide at Standard & Poors near the WTC and was exposed to toxic air for months before developing lymphoma, then died from COVID-19 on May 9.
She died two weeks after being released from a nursing home on Staten Island after treatment for her cancer, said her daughter, Lisa Venosa. The daughter said she believes her mother contracted the coronavirus while at the nursing home.
“My mom survived 9/11, and then she got lymphoma, and then she got COVID. We still are in disbelief,” Venosa said."

A study by the Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis found traffic declined by about 75% after the emergency health regulation went into effect in March, the Ventura County Star reports.
The number of animals struck and killed by vehicles also fell, including a 58% decrease in fatal crashes involving mountain lions between the 10 weeks before and 10 weeks after the order was in place.
The report was one of four released by the center concerning traffic-related impacts of the state’s stay-at-home order, including two studies of vehicle accidents and another of fuel use and climate change.
Using carcass and crash reports, researchers found California’s count of 8.4 large wild animals per day killed by vehicles decreased 21% to 6.6 animals.
Researchers studied data from the past five years and did not find a similar decline in wildlife and vehicle collisions. Wildlife fatality figures normally increase in the spring, Shilling said."

“They are just so happy to send heavily armed militia forces into our neighborhood because they’re afraid of the size of our wedding party,” Borough Park pol Kalman Yeger told Radio 620 AM, according to a clip of the interview circulating on social media.
“We have skyrocketing crime in New York City, and we have an entire department, a sheriff’s department — armed, uniformed police-style cars with lights and sirens. And what are they doing?
“They’re coming to Borough Park to check out our weddings. They’re standing on bridges, stopping motorists, asking them where they’re coming from, where they’re going.
“Is this really the best use of government resources?’’ Yeger said.
“Anyone who asks me, if you see them approaching a wedding hall — lock the doors and don’t let them in,’’ he said in the clip.
The pol later told to The Post the short clip was taken out of context from an hour-long interview and that he was “not telling people to not comply with lawful orders of law enforcement.
“We are a community of people when we receive an order from someone with a badge, we comply,” Yeger said.
City Sheriff Joseph Fucito declined comment to The Post.
Borough Park has been the epicenter of a worrying “uptick” in coronavirus cases in the city, fueled by events such as weddings, officials have said.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo last week vowed to crack down on the large parties if the city wouldn’t.
Cuomo had limited the number of people at indoor weddings, but the rule was eventually challenged in court, and the plaintiffs won in a ruling earlier this month that gave two weddings the OK to proceed with 50% capacity.
While one of the nuptials went ahead, the other has been put on hold after Cuomo’s office appealed the ruling.
Meanwhile, every other wedding in the state must stick to a 50-person limit.

541,New York’s public colleges see enrollment dip amid COVID-19 pandemic,https://nypost.com/2020/08/30/new-yorks-public-colleges-see-enrollment-dip-amid-covid-19/,2020-08-30 00:00:00,"Enrollment at New York’s public colleges has dropped amid the coronavirus, according to preliminary figures obtained by The Post.
The number of students at City University of New York schools has fallen by 4.4 percent for at least the fall semester, according to early figures reported by many of its 25 campuses.
That contrasts with CUNY’s surging enrollment in previous years. Last fall, CUNY reported a 2.8 percent increase in enrollment for its freshmen class, or 40,768 new students — a record.
Still, CUNY officials said more time is needed to get a fuller picture of enrollment and analyze what impact COVID-19 has had.
“As several of our colleges are on different academic calendars, offer rolling admissions or delayed their commitment dates in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is premature to project a final university enrollment total,” said CUNY spokesman Frank Sobrino.
He said he could not yet provide a specific breakdown yet for CUNY’s 11 senior colleges or seven community colleges, in addition to its graduate programs.
Meanwhile, a rep for the 64-campus State University of New York system said preliminarily, enrollment is down 5 percent at its four-year colleges compared to last year. That follows a trend of decreased enrollment over the past few years.
But SUNY spokeswoman Holly Liapis stressed that the latest figure was based on early estimates and doesn’t include its community colleges.
A rep for the New York Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities said data was not yet available on fall enrollment for its member schools.
State Sen. Toby Stavisky (D-Queens), chairwoman of that body’s Higher Education Committee, said she has no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has hurt college enrollment.
Many colleges and universities are offering most, if not all, of their classes online to help avoid new outbreaks of the killer virus.
“Obviously COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on all colleges and universities,” Stavisky said.
Just a week or so into the new semester, local college officials have already suspended students for infractions of COVID-19 health rules, including holding illicit parties on campus. These are mostly schools — such as Syracuse University and SUNY Plattsburgh — where students live on campus in dorms.
SUNY Oneonta officials announced Sunday that they were closing the campus for at least two weeks — after more than 100 people there tested positive for the coronavirus amid large parties during opening week.
At many schools, students have had to show proof that they tested negative for the coronavirus just to gain access to campus.
Meanwhile Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a new health order that says any colleges that report 100 or more positive cases for COVID-19 must go fully to remote learning for two weeks until the infection rate on campus is lowered.
But Stavisky also cited factors other than the pandemic for enrollment woes.
She said some of the colleges’ financial existence were “already in jeopardy” before the pandemic hit.
“Let us not forget that both the city and state have been losing population. Another contributing factor is the loss of international students who pay full `sticker price’ tuition,” the senator said.
Stavisky also noted that evidence nationally shows that some students have decided to take a year off during the pandemic.
“To help alleviate these problems, we need a stimulus package from Washington,” DC, she said."

The US overwhelmingly leads the world’s current tally with 6 million cases, the site said. The nations with the next two highest tallies are Brazil and India, with 3.8 million and 3.5 million cases, respectively.
But the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that the true figures are likely much higher — and up to 10 times more in the US alone thanks to testing issues and the fact that mild cases often go undetected.
California became the first state to surpass the 700,000-case mark as of Saturday morning. It was forced to slow its reopening plans last week amid concerns over the deadly pandemic."

Even though classes only started Monday, local officials pushed to test the 3,000 students and teachers after many showed symptoms of COVID-19 following “several large parties,” SUNY Chancellor Jim Malatras said.
As of Sunday, at least 105 have tested positive — an alarming 3 percent of students and teachers on campus, Malatras said.
The campus is now being closed for at least two weeks — and five students were suspended along with three student organizations, which were not identified.
“We’re going to be tough on those students not because we want to ruin their fun, but this is a different time,” Malatras said, referring to the “new normal.”
Local residents are also being offered three rapid-result tests. “Many of the students live off campus. There’s a lot of interaction in the community,” Malatras told reporters. “We want to manage the any potential spread and address it immediately.”
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it highlighted fears that reopening schools and colleges could damage New York’s progress against the coronavirus.
As of Sunday,  429 were hospitalized with the virus across the Empire State — the lowest figure since March.
“Colleges to me are very much a canary in the coal mine,” he said, warning they showed “what happens when you bring back a concentration of people” as the pandemic continues.
“I studied when I was in college, but I know not everyone was in the library when I was there. I understand,” he said of the parties.
“But if the students act irresponsibly, or the precautions are not in place, then the virus will spread, and then more dramatic action is going to have to be taken,” he warned.
The governor said it should serve as an alarm for other schools wrestling with how to open safely, too.
“Everybody’s anxious to get back to school, I get it. But everybody should be anxious to get back to a safe school,” he said."

NEW DELHI — India registered 78,761 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, the biggest single-day spike in the world since the pandemic began, just as the government began easing restrictions to help the battered economy.
The surge raised India’s tally to over 3.5 million, and came as the government announced the reopening of the subway in New Delhi, the capital. It also will move ahead with limited sports and religious events next month.
A country of 1.4 billion people, India now has the fastest-growing daily coronavirus caseload of any country in the world, reporting more than 75,000 new cases for four straight days.
One of the reasons is testing: India now conducts nearly 1 million tests every day, compared with just 200,000 two months ago.
A significant feature of India’s COVID-19 management, however, is the growing rate of recovered patients. On Sunday, the recovery rate reached nearly 76.5%.
The Health Ministry credited its strategic policy of “testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively and treating efficiently” in supervised home isolation and hospitals.
But COVID-19 fatalities continue to mount and soon India will have the third-largest death toll, after the United States and Brazil, even though it has had far fewer deaths than those two countries.
India is now reporting around 1,000 COVID-19 deaths every day. So far, more than 63,000 Indians have died from the disease.
Even as eight states remain among the worst-hit regions and contribute nearly 73% of the total infections, the virus is now spreading fast in the vast hinterlands, with health experts warning that September could be the most challenging month yet. Early last week, members of a small secluded tribe in the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands tested positive for the coronavirus.
So far, the biggest contributor to the new surge has been the western state of Maharashtra, home to the commercial capital of Mumbai. It alone has accounted for more than 24,000 deaths and nearly 21% of all cases.
India’s economy — the fifth largest in the world — has been severely hit by the pandemic. But despite the surging cases, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team have been pushing for a return to normalcy to ease the pain.
The federal government on Saturday said the crowded subway, a lifeline for millions of people in New Delhi, will reopen gradually starting Sept. 7. Schools, colleges and movie theaters will remain closed until the end of September."

The first glitch of the US Open bubble occurred Sunday morning when the USTA announced an unnamed player tested positive for COVID-19 and will be disqualified. The Post confirmed a L’Equipe report the player is Frenchman Benoit Paire.
Under CDC and New York State guidelines, Paire must self-isolate for 10 days, meaning he’s done for the Open. The greater concern is whether he spread the virus and contract tracing is being conducted, the USTA stated.
The No. 17-seeded Paire was set to face Poland’s Kamil Majchrzak. The USTA removed Paire’s name from the draw on its website and replaced him with Marcel Granollers. Under HIPPA laws, the USTA was not allowed to confirm the name of the player, only reporting he was asymptomatic.
The Open is set to begin Monday. To reduce virus risks, the Western & Southern Open was moved from Cincinnati to Flushing and completed Saturday to create a tighter bubble. Players are only allowed to be at the player hotel on Long Island or on the grounds, where they must wear masks.
Paire was entered in the Open tuneup but did not complete his first-round match, retiring in the second set at 6-0, 1-0, appearing unwell on the court.
The French newspaper reported Frenchmen Richard Gasquet, Adrian Mannarino, Gregoire Barrere and Edouard Vasselin were also told to self-isolate. Players are tested every four days."

Messi did not show up for Barcelona’s preseason coronavirus testing on Sunday, according to multiple reports, digging in his heels after he informed the club on Tuesday he wanted to leave and was exercising a clause in his contract that allowed him to do so for free.
The 33-year-old soccer superstar wants to go to Manchester City — whose offer could include a potential move to New York City FC in three years — but Barcelona insist the opt-out clause expired in June. Messi’s camp believes he’s still able to exercise the opt-out because of the coronavirus-related extension of the season.
The Spanish La Liga is taking Barcelona’s side in the dispute, saying in a statement Sunday that Messi’s contract is still valid and another team would have to pay a 700 million euro release clause — roughly $833 million — to get Messi, whose contract expires at the end of next season.

The team is self-isolating in Houston after conducting testing and contract tracing for everyone in its traveling party, according to a release.
Coronavirus has caused significant disruption to the MLB schedule as the league attempts to play through the pandemic. Outbreaks within the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals led to long pauses in their seasons. The Mets, Phillies and Reds have also had coronavirus cases.

548,First college football game in coronavirus era has some fans,https://nypost.com/2020/08/30/first-college-football-game-in-coronavirus-era-has-some-fans/,2020-08-30 00:00:00,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — With masks, social distancing and mostly empty stands, the college football season kicked off COVID-19 style.
Austin Peay and Central Arkansas, two teams fresh from FCS playoff appearances, took the stage at Cramton Bowl Saturday night in the Guardian Kickoff Classic. The Bears won 24-17 but college football was the star of the show.
“It’s the first game from the pandemic, and so it should mean that much more to everybody. Not just the players,” said Dave Dotson, whose family drove in from Texas to see son Simeon, a defensive back for Central Arkansas. 
Only 2,000 tickets were distributed at the 22,000-seat stadium, and there appeared to be significantly fewer fans actually attending. A number of them were family members of players.
Masks were required coming into the gates, walking around the stadium and at the concession stands. Coaches and players also wore them on the sidelines.
Dave and Juliana Dotson decided to make the drive with teen sons Reuben and Ephraim — which turned into about 12 hours Friday because of Hurricane Laura-related detours — after seeing the precautions being taken at the game.
“It made us feel a little better about being here,” Juliana said. “It said there would be four seats in between each group and two rows, so there would be social distancing put in place.”
UAB professor of infectious diseases Michael Saag said the game would be “a good test case” for college football and other events. Both teams were tested Wednesday.
“Let’s pull back to the big picture: Everything we do in this epidemic is an experiment of sorts,” said Saag, who is also associate dean for global health. “Nobody really knows what’s going to happen at any event or with any type of exposure. 
“We know the general principles and I think every human being on the planet can quote line and verse about mask-wearing distance. But each situation is different. I have been awed by the power of this virus and its ability to being transmitted from person to person.”
He cited the number of outbreaks already on campuses of colleges and universities.
Austin Peay didn’t disclose the number of players, coaches or staffers affected by COVID-19. But athletic director Gerald Harrison posted on Twitter that the team brought 70 players as usual. 
The biggest name missing was wide receiver DeAngelo Wilson, a second-team AP FCS All-American last season.
“None of the individuals representing Austin Peay in Montgomery, Alabama, tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19,” Harrison wrote.
Central Arkansas didn’t have any key players fail to make the trip.
Central Arkansas coach Nathan Brown acknowledged leading up to the “Week Zero” game that there had been some uneasiness with going forward with a season. It was hard to avoid the news that leagues like the Pac-12 and Big Ten opted against playing this fall.
“This season was hanging on a thread and we knew that we had to do things right and we knew that our players had to truly buy into that,” Brown said. “As a human being, you’re naturally going to go through the emotions of what you see and what you feel. 
“But what I encouraged our guys to do was not pay attention to social media, pay attention to what’s right in front of you in Conway, Arkansas, at the University of Central Arkansas and base your judgment on that. And I think we’ve handled things well.”
Fans and teams — and college football in general — are hoping for a positive outcome for both players and those who sat in the stands for Game 1 of the COVID-19 experiment.
The first glitch came when Austin Peay’s freshman CJ Evans scored on a 75-yard touchdown run to start the game. The referee’s mic was live when he cursed “God damn mask.”
The family of Austin Peay’s Geordon Pollard drove down from Birmingham to see the starting wide receiver and his team play. Father George Pollard is used to being around people for his job at a car manufacturing plant and said he had no reservations.
“Ready to get out of the house,” Pollard said. “Ready for college football to kick off.”"

A coronavirus tide is rolling at the University of Alabama — where 1,200 students have tested positive since the school opened this month.
The alarming stat was reported on the university’s own online “COVID-19 Dashboard.”
Classes had resumed two weeks ago at the school — home of the Crimson Tide football team —  where nearly 30,000 students attend.
University President Stuart R. Bell had already termed the rise in cases “unacceptable” a week prior, on Aug. 23, in an online letter to faculty, staff and students.
At that point, total infections among students, faculty and staff had topped 500.
The university president did not immediately address the new spike."

The campground and catering hall has admitted it screwed up its head-count when it allowed a restriction-violating mob to celebrate an Aug. 7 wedding — a reception now linked to at least 123 people contracting COVID-19.
One died from the disease.
In a statement obtained by the local Pressherald.com, the venue in the wooded town of Millinocket conceded that it had misinterpreted state guidelines limiting indoor events to 50 people.
The Big Moose Inn thought the limit meant only 50 people per individual room, the statement said.
So the venue allowed 65 people to attend, splitting them into two rooms.
When additional Big Moose Inn guests from that night were factored in, the venue held more than 100 people in the same building.
“The state – perhaps, rightfully so – assumes that individuals from a larger group would ignore the room restrictions, and take the opportunity to co-mingle,” the Big Moose statement conceded.
The night’s festivities are being blamed for subsequent outbreaks at a nearby county jail and a Madison nursing home, the Press Herald reported."
551,Brooklyn karaoke bar shuttered over coronavirus violations,https://nypost.com/2020/09/06/brooklyn-karaoke-bar-shuttered-over-coronavirus-violations/,2020-09-06 00:00:00,"A Brooklyn karaoke bar was shut down and had its liquor license revoked Sunday after authorities found more than 281 people packed inside — including a child under 10 years old, officials said.
Legend KTV in Borough Park is the third karaoke bar shuttered by the New York City Sheriff’s Office and the state Liquor Authority in the past week, as authorities clamp down on illegal gatherings in the midst of social-distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Deputies raided 61st Street nightspot shortly before 2 a.m. Sunday and found patrons drinking, dancing, smoking while exceeding the bar’s occupancy limit of 245 — with none wearing masks or social distancing, authorities said.
The building had only one door, the sheriff’s office said.
The young child, whose exact age was not released, was seen dancing “where alcoholic beverages were being served,” the office said in an email.
The Liquor Authority revoked the bar’s license, listed to Legend KTV – Brother Holding Group, Inc., for “failing to comply with applicable health, safety, and governmental regulations,” and peddling booze in portions of the business not licensed to serve alcohol.
Six people were hit with charges that included liquor-law violations, violating Mayor Bill de Blasio’s coronavirus restrictions, and using unlicensed security guards. One person was also charged with endangering the welfare of a child, the sheriff’s office said.
No one answered the phone at the lounge on Sunday.
The announcement comes just days after deputies shuttered a Queens karaoke bar on similar violations.
CJ Diamond Cafe on College Point Boulevard was raided around 11:30 p.m., prompting about 100 revelers to run for the exits when the deputies showed up — leaving the remaining revelers and five managers with summonses.
On Aug. 31, another Queens bar, SOHO KTV & Bar on Farrington Street in Flushing, was also shut down for serving alcohol and food indoors to about 75 customers, authorities said.
The patrons were forced to leave the bar and two managers were cited for violations."
552,Costa Rica researchers to trial COVID-19 treatment from horse antibodies,https://nypost.com/2020/09/06/costa-rica-researchers-to-trial-covid-19-treatment-from-horses/,2020-09-06 00:00:00,"SAN JOSE – Researchers in Costa Rica are due to begin trials of an inexpensive coronavirus treatment based on antibodies taken from horses injected with the SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to scientists.
Developed by University of Costa Rica’s Clodomiro Picado Institute (ICP), the equine antibodies medication is to be tested on 26 patients from mid-September, Roman Macaya, president of the Social Security Fund that manages public health centers, told Reuters.
Costa Rican authorities hope to be able to begin applying the treatment more widely in hospitals if the results from the phase 2 study are encouraging. There are 471 hospitalized coronavirus patients in Costa Rica.
“We are proud to know that this product will save lives until the vaccine reaches the population,” said Alberto Alape, a project coordinator at ICP.
“We do it with our resources, without having to stand in line or compete against other countries, as can be seen with possible vaccines.”
Similar efforts are also underway in Argentina and Brazil, while scientists in Belgium are using llamas.
Costa Rican researchers say their method for SARS-Cov-2 treatment is based on the experience of using horse antibodies to develop snake anti-venoms.
They imported the virus protein from China and the United Kingdom and injected it into six of the 110 horses that the IPC uses for testing.
Weeks later, when the animals developed enough antibodies, they extracted blood and used the antibodies from the plasma as raw material for the injectable serum.
If it works, the researchers say they want to share the inexpensive treatment with other Central American nations, which are mostly poorer than Costa Rica.
“In addition to the principle of solidarity and the fact that this has been done with anti-venom for snakebites, we know that in a pandemic, one’s own well-being is related to the well-being of neighbors,” Alape said."

About 250 to 300 members of the Good Company Bike Club employed pedal power to get from Crown Heights’ Lincoln Terrace Park to Fort Greene Park.
“[The] West Indian Day Parade was canceled, obviously, because of COVID, but biking is still safe. So, we decided to celebrate in this way,” said Andre Thompson, 39, a captain of the ride. “We’re just trying to get everybody outside, but in a safe way.”
The ride — a ticketed event capped at 300 participants, with an NYPD escort for safety’s sake — was intended partly to bring awareness to Caribbeans for Black Lives, and partly to let people celebrate the region’s culture with the annually people-packed Labor Day parade scrapped due to COVID-19 concerns.
“This is something to do when we are all usually locked in the house because of COVID,” said Askia Simmons, 37, who rode wearing the flag of Trinidad and Tobago. “It gives us the opportunity to come out and have fun.”
Marv Marcel, chief creative officer of the Good Company Bike Club, agreed that the event was a healthy compromise with the parade a no-go.
“We couldn’t have any huge things happening, so we figured it’s safe, we can practice social distancing while being on bikes and being healthy,” said Marcel, 30."

The United Kingdom announced Sunday that it registered 2,988 new infections in the past 24 hours, compared to 1,813 Saturday and a high of 2,959 on May 23.
The country’s death toll is currently the highest in Europe, at 41,551.
Meanwhile, India broke its previous global record involving positive tests in a single day — putting it on track to surpass Brazil by Monday as the nation second only to the US in terms of cases.
India now has 4.1 million confirmed cases, while the US has 6.4 million.
“We could say that we are seeing some sort of a second [coronavirus] wave in certain parts of the country,” said India government health expert Randeep Guleria, citing fatigue over restrictions as at least one reason for the virus spike.
India’s dismal new record came as the son of a Punjab political leader was arrested along with 53 others Friday for violating social-distancing guidelines at a pool party, reports said.
Locally, in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that the state had seen its 30th straight day of positive-test results below 1 percent.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are still deadlocked on another coronavirus stimulus bill — but they expect to reach a deal this week on a continuing resolution to keep the government open past the end of the month.
“The speaker has refused to sit down and negotiate unless we agree to something like a $2.5 trillion deal in advance,” Mnuchin said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We put $3 trillion into the economy when the economy was completely shut down. We’ve now reopened the economy.”
The secretary suggested a “more targeted bill.”
“If we need to do more in 30 days, we’ll continue to do more. But let’s not hold up the American workers and American businesses that need more support,” Mnuchin said.
But he said he and Pelosi have agreed on averting a government shutdown and to keep it open until at least December.
“So, for now, the most important thing is to make sure at the end of the month, we don’t shutdown the government and we get something past the election,” he said, adding that it will be separate from the stimulus spending package.
But Pelosi, during an interview on MSNBC, blamed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for hitting “pause” after House Democrats passed their own $3 trillion HEROES Act in May.
“We’re not doing anything. Now, could we have saved all of those people? Not all, but many. The number of people who have been infected has grown by the millions,” Pelosi said.
“We have to make sure the public knows how we can solve this, and why the administration is standing in the way of crushing the virus,” she said on “AM Joy.”"
556,Kamala Harris says she wouldn’t take Trump’s word about a COVID-19 vaccine,https://nypost.com/2020/09/06/kamala-harris-says-she-wouldnt-take-trumps-word-about-a-covid-19-vaccine/,2020-09-06 00:00:00,"Sen. Kamala Harris, the democratic vice presidential nominee, accused President Trump of downplaying the “seriousness” of the coronavirus pandemic and said she wouldn’t take his word that a COVID-19 vaccine was ready for use.
“I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he’s talking about,” she said during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” that aired on Sunday. “I will not take his word for it.”
Trump and officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that a vaccine could be ready to ship to the states for distribution by Nov. 1 — two days before Election Day.
“From the beginning of this pandemic, he has called it a hoax, has muzzled the public health experts. He has minimized the seriousness of it. He has created false expectations for the American people and American families, even though if he had listened to the scientists and the experts, he would have understood the gravity of it,” the California lawmaker said as the virus’ death toll in the US neared 190,000.
“His priority was to to do whatever he thought was politically expedient,” Harris continued.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force and a leading expert in infectious diseases, last week said it’s “conceivable” a vaccine could be ready by November and assured that it would be safe to use if it is approved by the feds.
“I will look at the data and I would assume — and I’m pretty sure it’s going to be the case — that a vaccine would not be approved for the American public unless it was indeed both safe and effective,” Fauci said.
But asked by host Dana Bash whether health experts would have the final word on a vaccine, Harris claimed they would be “muzzled.”
“If past is prologue they will not. They’ll be muzzled, they’ll be suppressed. They will be sidelined because he’s looking at an election coming up in less than 60 days. And he’s grasping for whatever he can get to pretend that he has been a leader on this issue when he is not,” she said.
Asked if she trusted Fauci, Harris said she did.
“I think Dr. Fauci has proven for anyone who has been watching him for years and years to put the public health of the American people as the highest priority in terms of his work and his reputation and his priority,” Harris said. “Yes, I trust Dr. Fauci.”"
557,NYU warns students about COVID-19 rules after rager in Washington Square Park,https://nypost.com/2020/09/06/nyu-warns-students-about-covid-19-rules-after-washington-square-park-rager/,2020-09-06 00:00:00,"NYU warned students to remain socially distant in public after a video surfaced showing hundreds of young people congregating in Washington Square Park on Saturday night.
The school made the announcement after young adults were seen drinking, dancing, and not adhering to social distancing guidelines at the popular outdoor NYU hangout just days after classes resumed on Wednesday.
“If you’re having a good time, let me hear ya say yeah,” shouted an MC at the iconic fountain, surrounded by kids who were not wearing masks or face coverings.
The video shows police cars and officers stationed outside the park seemingly on standby, but not appearing to enforce any crowd control.
The public park is just steps away from NYU, surrounded by the university’s dorms and academic buildings.
Cleanup was underway Sunday morning, with a Parks Department crew seen cleaning trash from the overnight party.
“We have received reports and videos of large crowds of young people gathering in Washington Square Park last night, with some people not wearing masks or distancing,”  Marc Wais, senior vice president for student affairs, wrote in a statement Sunday night.
 
He continued, “We are investigating the circumstances from last night and any students who have violated our expectations will be subject to disciplinary action.”
NYU tweeted on Saturday that more than 20 students had been suspended for breaking the school’s new coronavirus policies as colleges grapple with how to keep young adults from spreading COVID-19.
The school, which did not provide details about the suspensions, tweeted the update after less than a week of in-person instruction.
“Please don’t be the next. Avoid parties and bars,” the school said. “Wear a mask. Keep your distance.”
By Sunday night, college-age adults were again seen gathered inside the park and largely ignoring social distancing measures.
Some of the people were spotted consuming alcohol and smoking marijuana in view of two NYPD officers stationed outside the park."
558,Joe Biden is in a bind due to COVID-19,https://nypost.com/2020/09/06/joe-biden-is-in-a-bind-due-to-covid-19/,2020-09-06 00:00:00,"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his handlers have known that he should have been out and about, weighing in daily on the issues of the campaign.
In impromptu interviews, Biden should be offering alternative plans for dealing with the virus, the lockdown, the economic recovery, the violence and the looting and racial tensions.
Yet until Biden’s recent press outing and visit to Kenosha, Wis., his handlers seem to have assumed that if he were to leave his basement and fully enter the fray, he could be capable of losing the election in moments of gaffes, lapses or prolonged silences.
So wisely, Team Biden relied on the fact that the commander-in-chief is always blamed for bad news — and there has been plenty of bad news worldwide this year.
That reality was reflected in the spring and early-summer polls that showed growing discontent with the incumbent, President Trump, as if he were solely responsible for one of the most depressing years in US history.
But news cycles, like polls, are not always static. What was true in July is not necessarily so in September and especially in November. Volatile years produce volatile voters.
Now, many voters think they see a waning of the virus, a need to get their kids back in school, and a glimmer of hope that the economy is recovering.
A large segment of the public is becoming irate at the nightly looting, destruction and arson that no longer seem to have much to do with the May death of George Floyd while in police custody. Where are the police, the mayors and the governors to protect the vulnerable, the law-abiding and the small-business owners?
Biden knows the mercurial polls now tell him that he must permanently re-emerge and cease being a virtual candidate. Yet he knows that if he does, he risks losing the race. So his surrogates talk of mandatory fact-checking of the debates — or even canceling them entirely.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently said that Biden “should not concede under any circumstances,” apparently even if he loses the November election. If the rules no longer favor Biden, then it seems time to change the rules.
So Biden has become a tragic prisoner of his own paradoxes.
He is an old centrist who forged a Faustian bargain with socialist Bernie Sanders and his hardcore leftist supporters. That alliance was felt necessary to win the Democratic nomination and the general election.
The hard left provided the urban fireworks this summer that seemed to drive down Trump’s poll numbers. Blue-state governors and mayors contextualized the violence as a “summer of love” or “largely peaceful.”
Until late last week, Biden stayed mum — both because the polls suggested he should remain so, and because he could hardly criticize those whose often violent acts were creating a sense of national anarchy under Trump’s presidency and thus undeniably aiding the Biden candidacy.
But as CNN news anchor Don Lemon recently warned his fellow leftists, now the polls are changing. Lemon apparently fears that the public is sick of seeing the urban unrest. Suddenly, many members of the media want Biden to condemn the rioting and violence.
But if Biden did, he might alienate his now-critical left-wing Bernie base. Yet Biden’s continued reluctance to unequivocally fault the rioters and arsonists may be alienating moderate suburban swing voters.
The same paradox surrounds the debates. Should Biden, as promised, debate Trump?
Yes. But would he thereby blow up his candidacy in a moment of incoherence?
No. But would he end up ridiculed in absentia, like Clint Eastwood’s empty chair at the 2012 Republican convention?
Trump never sits still. So should Biden match the president’s frenzied pace and hold town halls, impromptu interviews, tarmac rallies, photo ops on the campaign trail and daily unscripted press conferences? But to do so could confirm to voters that he is frail and confused.
We saw some evidence of that danger in his Aug. 31 address in Pittsburgh after Biden finally emerged from his basement. He seemed confused about the COVID-19 death tally and could not quite follow his own teleprompter:
“Look, the lives, when you think about it, more lives this year than any other year for the past 100 years,” Biden said.
Few knew what he meant. And when Biden also claimed that he never opposed fracking, his opponents came out almost immediately with past clips of him being critical of fracking and favoring the phasing out of fossil fuels.
How did Biden become a prisoner of his own paradoxes?
Perhaps he knew that he was not physically or cognitively up to running a real campaign. But he ran all the same.
Perhaps he knew that the violence of Antifa and other agitators could eventually hurt more than help him, but for months he kept silent about the violence all the same, given the perceived political damage to Trump.
Perhaps he knew that he had always opposed the wacky agenda of Sanders, but Biden wrongly felt he could pose as a moderate in 2020 yet if elected, keep a promise to the socialists of the more radical wing of his party to govern as a leftist.
Perhaps he knows that his new progressive allies would be happy for him to win them a presidency but even happier for him to then disappear as soon as possible.
Paradoxes happen when what seems real is not — and is known not to be real by those who act as if it is."
559,Elderly New Yorkers languish on wait lists for critical services amid COVID-19,https://nypost.com/2020/09/06/elderly-new-yorkers-languish-on-wait-lists-for-critical-services-amid-covid-19/,2020-09-06 00:00:00,"The pandemic has dramatically increased the number of elderly New Yorkers waiting for help from city-funded agencies — and it will be months before the residents get the services they need, advocates say.
New data from LiveOn NY, a senior advocacy group, shows that the number of older Big Apple residents waiting to receive everything from personal-care help to a lift to the supermarket has soared 265 percent, to 2,936 people, since February.
That figure — fueled by coronavirus fears over venturing out and budget cuts — comes from a survey completed by the 15 non-profit organizations contracted by the city’s Department for the Aging to connect the elderly with needed services through case management, LiveOn NY told The Post.
“It just seems to be growing exponentially,” Allison Nickerson, LiveOn NY’s executive director, said of the wait for services. “It’s catastrophic to people’s lives.”
“You have a virus that specifically is affecting older New Yorkers … and there’s been zero investment in trying to figure that out. In fact, there are cuts,” she said.
Case management is the gateway to senior services and is designed to keep the elderly stabilized and safely living at home so they can stay out of nursing homes and hospitals, which are bigger drains on public dollars and lead to a reduced quality of life, providers say.
“The difference between somebody who lives safely in their home or being forced to go into a nursing home could be simply that their bills are piling up and they don’t know how to manage them,” said Jonah Gensler, the associate executive director for community services at Sunnyside Community Services, one of the survey’s respondents.
Jolene Boden, Sunnyside’s case management program director, said, “Somebody could possibly have to leave their home and go to some kind of supportive housing because they can’t change the linen on their bed, and that’s just mind boggling.’’
Monserrate Arteca, 79, of Brooklyn is currently on a wait list through senior-service provider RiseBoro Community Partnership to get help with such things as housekeeping, and personal care.
“I worry,’’ said Arteca, who lives in the Williamsburg Houses. “It’s a lot of stress.’’
She had recently been waiting for a call from her doctor to fulfill a prescription, only to realize her phone wasn’t working and that’s why she hadn’t heard from them.
Before the pandemic, many older New Yorkers such as Arteca relied on their families or local community groups for help, but those support systems have been stripped away, making them more reliant on city-funded services, providers say.
In the city’s fiscal-year 2021 budget, the city’s Department for the Aging has been cut by $33.1 million. The agency has called the reduction “modest’’ and says it “does not impact core DFTA programs” and there are “no new needs in the Executive Budget,” records show.
The providers who spoke to The Post said that is simply not the case.
“The waiting list to get on our case-management-service list is higher than we’ve ever seen it, and that’s because so many more seniors are homebound at this point,” said Scott Short, the CEO of RiseBoro, another one of the survey’s respondents.
“They can’t get out and get to the senior centers, they can’t get out and get to their community groups, get to the supermarket even, and so while the demand for these services has ballooned, the city has not responded with a corollary demand in allowing us to meet the need.”
Boden said her agency’s case managers used to have an average caseload of 60 to 65 people and that it is now between 70 and 73 — and there are still nearly 200 people on their waiting list.
“We need to have funding for more staff so that we can employ more case managers,” Boden said.
The biggest need providers have come across involves food, and while the city’s ambitious GetFood program has aimed to fill that need outside of the DFTA, senior providers say the program is imperfect at best.
“There was a real lack of collaboration and coordination with the providers, like RiseBoro, who understood the needs of the seniors in communities, and it led to a lot of inefficiency and waste in the system and a lot of low quality services and food making its way to the seniors in need,” Short said.
Joshua Goodman, a spokesman for the GetFood program, said in response that New Yorkers can report any problems by calling 311 or going to nyc.gov/getfoodhelp.
“No New Yorker should go hungry due to the pandemic. We are delivering nearly 1 million meals per day, and while these are emergency meals, they must meet strict guidelines about quality,” Goodman said.
But as younger New Yorkers venture back out into the city, emboldened by record-low infection rates, the elderly are still stuck inside, and their mental and physical health is rapidly deteriorating without services, Nickerson said.
Many older New Yorkers might not even be alive by the time they make it off the waitlist, she added.
“When it’s a political priority, the city finds money to do what it needs to do, and it is obvious in this time, to me, that older New Yorkers are not a priority because the city has not put resources or even talk behind this issue. We’re in this for the long haul and these are people’s real lives, these are our families, ourselves, and it’s just really disturbing how it’s not even part of the conversation.”
The city Department for the Aging said in a statement to The Post, “The City is in an unprecedented financial and public health crisis that has impacted all City agencies and their respective budgets.
“Amid these challenges, DFTA and its providers continue to serve older New Yorkers with the same high-quality programs and services.
“While we have seen an increase in demand for services, DFTA’s case-management program is continuing to take on new clients. Everyone who calls to receive case-management services receives an intake over the phone and is connected to available services, and those with more urgent needs receive a full assessment.
“Older adults have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. We hope the federal government will provide additional support and resources needed at this time.”"
560,Dominic Thiem completes stunning rally to win US Open,https://nypost.com/2020/09/13/dominic-thiem-rallies-to-beat-alexander-zverev-for-us-open-title/,2020-09-13 00:00:00,"It was the weekend of comebacks at the U.S. Open in Flushing — a fitting tribute to a city that has made one helluva COVID comeback.
The Twilight Zone version of the fan-less Open concluded Sunday in an epic four-hour match and a first-ever fifth-set tiebreaker of a men’s final.
Austrian Dominic Thiem rallied from two sets down and an early break in the third to post a five-set 2-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) victory over German Alexander Zverev at empty Arthur Ashe Stadium.
When it was over, Thiem and Zverev, two German-speaking tour buddies, broke the fortnight’s social protocols, slapping hands and embracing instead of tapping rackets as had been the coronavirus custom. Who could blame them.
“We are really good friends,’’ Thiem said. “We have a long-term friendship. We were both tested negative maybe 14 times. We didn’t put anyone in danger. We wanted to share the moment… We just wanted to share the moment. We didn’t put anybody in danger.”
It was the first time in 70 years a five-setter in a men’s Open final was won by a player who had been two sets down.
It’s been known for a week there would be a first-time men’s Grand Slam champion after Novak Djokovic’s disqualification. That turned out to be Thiem, the second seed who came in with a 7-2 record against his big-serving friend but admitted he was pressing early.
“I had a great career so far, way better career than I could ever dreamt of, but until today there was still a big part, a big goal missing,’’ Thiem said.
It finally ended with Zverev pulling a backhand wide as the cramping Austrian fell in joy onto his back.
“I was so tight at the beginning,’’ said Thiem, who had been in three prior Grand Slam finals. “I wanted this title so much, and of course there was also in my head that if I lose this one, it’s 0-4 [in Grand Slam finals]. We both didn’t face one of the Big 3. That was in the back of the head for both of us. That’s why we were on nerves.”
The classic men’s final came one day after the women’s final featured Naomi Osaka rallying from a horrifying first set to win her second women’s crown.
The fifth-set tiebreak matched the five-set win by Thiem over Zverev in the Australian Open semifinals. Thiem also rallied from 5-3 down in the fifth set with Zverev serving for the match and 2-0 in the fifth-set tiebreaker. Thiem said he cramped up late but his mind outperformed his body.
Zverev, after playing in his first Grand Slam final, choked up several times while receiving the runner-up trophy, having to pause for more than 10 seconds to gather himself when he referred to his parents as “important people missing in the crowd today.’’
For two sets, Thiem pounded his famous forehand deep and he looked oddly detached in his fourth Grand Slam final before settling in. Zverev started to show nerves late in the second set, blowing a 5-1 lead, but he held on to take a two-sets-to-none lead.
The momentum had shifted by then. Thiem reverted to his rock-solid baseline form to become the first Austrian to win a Grand Slam since Tomas Muster won the 1995 French Open.
The comeback capped a successfully healthy if controversial Open. While the world’s best player, Djokovic, was disqualified, it was not because of COVID-19 but for accidentally flicking a tennis ball that struck a female line judge in the neck.
No players tested positive for the coronavirus once the first ball was struck two weeks ago. The Flushing tennis center has come a long way since its turn as a harbor for COVID-19 patients in April— as did New York City, once the world’s hot spot.
“At the end we reflect back and say it’s safe, it’s been good for tennis, and it’s been financially good for the players and the tennis ecosystem,’’ USTA CEO Michael Dowse said.
The fifth set was a classic roller coaster. Thiem was up a break but double-faulted to let Zverev get the marathon back on serve with the German ultimately getting ahead 5-3. One more comeback remained for Thiem.
“When he served for the match, I was struggling physically, but I also thought that he is not the freshest anymore,’’ Thiem said. “The belief was stronger than the body.’’"
561,I was pro-lockdown for NYC — but now there’s no excuse for continuing it,https://nypost.com/2020/09/13/i-was-pro-lockdown-for-nyc-but-now-theres-no-need-to-continue/,2020-09-13 00:00:00,"What are we doing?
Living in New York City continues to feel like we’re in the Upside Down. Our COVID-19 positive rates are astonishingly low. Yet attractions, businesses and schools remain shuttered. If we knew in March that the lockdown would mean months ­before businesses got to reopen and longer than that until schools opened for in-person learning, would we have gone along?
I wouldn’t have. In March, I was at the forefront of calls to close schools. We needed to flatten the curves. We needed to stop the hospitals from getting overwhelmed. Those were worthwhile goals. What are the goals now? It’s insane to keep children locked down without a goal.
And the insanity doesn’t end there. Last week, Gov. Cuomo announced that finally restaurants in Gotham could reopen for indoor dining — but at an absurd 25 percent capacity. A friend with a 19-seat Brooklyn joint pointed out she could host 4.75 people.
The rest of the state has been open for indoor dining throughout the summer at 50 percent capacity, yet we didn’t experience any spikes in cases. Why is Cuo­mo punishing Big Apple restaurateurs and workers?
The irrationality is the most ­infuriating part. A few days ago, an announcement was made that public high schools in New York are canceling their football, volleyball and cheerleading fall seasons. But tennis, soccer and field hockey are somehow allowed. Huh? That’s so arbitrary.
I tried to not be overly bitter last week, as photos of my friends’ kids returning to real schools filled my Facebook feed.
They weren’t going back to school in far-off places. Plenty were returning to full-time, in-person schooling at public schools in nearby Long ­Island and private ones in Manhattan. My own kids won’t go back to any schooling until later this week, when city public schools will ­finally start — remotely.
Do private-school and suburban parents want teachers and kids to die? No. All have weighed the risks and benefits, taken the necessary precautions and decided that it’s ­unhealthier to remove kids from live education long term.
New York City schools are supposed to be returning to part-time in-person learning on Sept. 21. But few parents believe it will actually happen, mostly due to the total incompetence of everyone in charge of the reopening, the mixed messages from the top — and the cravenness of teachers unions.
During routine COVID-19 testing last week, two asymptomatic teachers tested positive in Brooklyn. The schools where they teach will now be delayed in opening. Did no one who makes policy foresee that we would have positive cases going forward? Is the plan simply to shut down schools every time there is a positive case? And are we doing that until COVID-19 disappears?
We didn’t sign up to stay home indefinitely.
I’m not an epidemiologist and I will largely follow what actual medical professionals direct us to do. But few epidemiologists are urging a continued lockdown to defeat COVID-19.
Writing in The New York Times in April, Gabriel Leung, an infectious-disease epidemiologist and dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, wrote that lockdowns can’t last forever “with­out causing enormous damage to economies and compromising peoples’ goodwill and emotional well-being.”
But more important, Leung noted, “containment has failed everywhere.” As we’ve seen spikes in countries like Australia and South Korea, previously considered “model” countries that handled the virus very well, that’s more important to remember than ever. We can’t defeat COVID-19 by continually shutting down.
I’ve taken COVID-19 seriously, both in this column and in my own family. But the strategy for New York simply makes no sense anymore. We need a longer-term direction for our city and state, and that direction should be based on science. Real science — not “science” wielded as a rhetorical cudgel by Cuomo and de Blasio.
We can’t continue in this fearfulness with a vague plan to wait out the virus while society collapses around us. Our elected officials need to offer rational guidance, or New Yorkers need to fight them. We’ve been complacent for long enough."
562,"Peter Navarro, CNN host Jake Tapper clash over Trump’s COVID-19 response",https://nypost.com/2020/09/13/trump-advisers-defend-covid-19-response-in-fiery-cnn-debate/,2020-09-13 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro and CNN’s Jake Tapper clashed repeatedly over President Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic during a combative interview on Sunday that the CNN host abruptly ended, leaving Navarro in mid-sentence.
Navarro argued on “State of the Union” that the president took the coronavirus seriously in January, February and March after the outbreak was first reported in China despite comments Trump made in an interview with Bob Woodward that he intentionally downplayed the virus.
The Trump ally pointed out that the president acted early to ban travel from China and ramped up production of medical equipment for hospital workers while not trying to panic Americans and cause chaos.
Tapper pressed Navarro why the president wasn’t being “straightforward with the American people?”
“He was straightforward,” Navarro responded.
“No, he wasn’t,” the CNN host countered.
“There was — look, look, Jake, Jake, I’m telling you what our strategy is,” Navarro said.
“Just answer the — it’s a very basic question,” Tapper said. “You want to talk about what you want to talk about, OK?”
Navarro accused Tapper of “cherry-picking.”
After several more minutes of back and forth, Navarro said Trump had prepared the administration for the steps it needed to take.
“The answer is, in February all the way through the middle of March, when the World Health Organization finally said there was a pandemic and China was hiding the information, finally, that’s when we knew that there was a pandemic,” he said. “And you know what, Jake? We were at that point prepared for the worst.”
Navarro noted that by then, the White House had personal protection equipment ready, as well as testing and vaccine development.
He later added that Tapper and CNN were “not honest with the American people.”
Moments later Tapper thanked Navarro for the interview and abruptly cut away even as the White House adviser repeating, “I answered the question.”
“I would just like to remind the American people watching that the United States has less than 5 percent of the world’s population, and the United States has more than 20 percent of the world’s coronavirus deaths. That is a fact.
It does not matter how many times he insults CNN,” Tapper said at the end of the segment.
Critics pounced on a series of recorded interviews Trump gave Woodward for his book “Rage,” out Tuesday, to attack the president’s handling of the pandemic.
In the interviews, Trump acknowledged he was aware of how “deadly” the coronavirus was in February and said he “wanted to always play it down.”
“I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic,” the president said.
He also told Woodward that he was aware it was more serious than the flu.
Meanwhile, Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel argued on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that: “The president was calm and steady and methodical.”
She emphasized that the president canceled travel from China on Jan. 31, created the White House coronavirus task force on Feb. 9, mobilized American companies to ramp up production of protective equipment and ventilators while increasing testing for the virus.
“These are things you want from a president. Think of what would have happened if he’d have gone out and said, ‘This is awful. We should all be afraid. We don’t have a plan,'” she continued.
“It would have been a run on the banks. It would have been a run on the hospitals. It would have been a run on the grocery stores.”
She compared Trump’s response to COVID-19 with former President George W. Bush’s actions during the terror attacks on Sept. 11 after he was informed the second tower had been struck by an airplane.
“George Bush didn’t stand up and say, ‘America’s been attacked by terrorists. Everyone panic.’ They created a plan and they presented calm and certainty in a difficult time,” McDaniel said.
“What’s different this time is Democrats are politicizing it because we have an election, instead of saying, ‘Let’s work with you, Mr. President, and make sure we’re all fighting a virus like we’ve never seen together.'”
McDaniel predicted, “history will look back on him well as how he handled this pandemic.”"
563,Companies are getting creative onboarding new hires working from home,https://nypost.com/2020/09/13/companies-getting-creative-onboarding-new-hires-working-remotely/,2020-09-13 00:00:00,"If you think that starting a job is stressful, imagine being responsible for onboarding a group of new hires just days after the COVID-19 shutdown began.
“I had 19 people scheduled to start, and four business days to turn a five-day orientation into a virtual experience,” said Mackenzie Egan, a talent-development specialist at Holmdel, NJ-based hiring platform iCIMS. Not only that, but she also had to ensure that their computers were loaded with all of the right software, tools and credentials and delivered to their homes prior to their first day.
“I was a little nervous about pulling it off,” said Egan.
That’s no wonder, because the stakes are high. According to Jobvite’s 2019 Job Seeker Nation survey, almost one-third of workers quit their jobs within the first 90 days. That translates into thousands of lost recruiting dollars. But, according to human resources consultant and speaker Laurie Ruettimann, “onboarding helps workers attach to the organization and to fall in love with the culture, so that down the road when [the employer asks] for a little extra, they say yes and don’t quit.”
It’s one of the reasons that, before COVID, iCIMS flew in new associates from all over the world. “This is when they learn about our core values — accountability, adaptability, customer commitment, drive, empathy, kaizen, passion and transparency,” Egan said.
Whether that mesh could occur with new employees sitting at a kitchen table instead of a conference room, no one knew. Egan spent more than one late night making sure that the new virtual format was engaging, relayed the same information and was fun.
Her efforts were worthwhile, according to Adam Koster, iCIMS’ incoming senior manager of marketing technology who joined the company in mid-March. “At first I was disappointed that I wasn’t going to have a chance to meet everyone and start building relationships in person,” he said. But between presentations made by company leaders on Zoom, functional training and opportunities to socialize with his onboarding cohort and bond, Koster gives Egan high marks.
He is especially keen on the games that they played. There was a virtual show and tell where participants were asked to present an object that revealed something about them. “It was like being in kindergarten again,” laughed Koster, who showed his “classmates” a note that his youngest son had left on his pillow. “Good luck on your first day at your new job, Dad,” it said.
Consequently, “onboarding was welcoming, informative and a blast,” Koster said.
Chelsea Lee, a people-development manager at Cockroach Labs, worried that the incoming class of Roachers (a nickname for the company’s employees) might have a “horrible experience” onboarding virtually. Peter Guagenti, Cockroach Labs’ incoming chief marketing officer, was supposed to fly in from San Francisco, but COVID-19 took that off the table. “I was really looking forward to meeting the team,” he said. The box of company swag — a T-shirt, stickers, a water bottle and a coffee cup — provided some comfort. Guagenti used them to decorate his home office.
Members of Cockroach Labs’ executive team, like vice president of product marketing Jim Walker, signed on to Google Meet to talk about the company. He gave a one-hour talk about the market the company is in and the great opportunity that was ahead of them all.
“This is the first time we’ve done onboarding during a global pandemic,” said Walker, noting that there may be advantages in doing it this way. “I really thought it was going to be a struggle, but everyone was engaged. There were fewer distractions. I walked away happy.”
Guagenti agreed. “It’s better than being trapped in one room,” he said, adding that there was time in his schedule to check in on his daughter’s schoolwork. There was also an activity, “doughnut pairings,” that Lee had arranged where two or more new hires are assigned to a virtual breakout room just to chat.
“We got to know each other as people — people whose spouses might have recently lost their jobs or their child care. I got to know my cohort pretty well, and this time we spent together will bind us,” he said. And instead of bonding over lunch in New York, Lee sent each of them a treat from Milk Bar.
At Iterable, a growth-marketing platform with locations in Denver, New York, San Francisco and London, Brooklynite Niki Simonutti helped onboard a new employee during the height of the pandemic. Along with the onboarding package (socks, notebooks, stickers) came a stipend for setting up a home workspace. Not only that, but the newcomers also received welcome messages from current employees via Slack.
On Day 1, the group was tasked with finding a creative commonality. “It had to be something specific,” said Simonutti, so an answer like, “We all work at Iterable,” wouldn’t do, whereas, “We all had a teacher named Ms. Johnson,” would. In addition, Yvette Ankunda, an HR generalist at the company, created a game called “Iterable Jeopardy,” which not only resembles the show but also uses the same music.
Both onboarding leaders and participants were happy with the experience, yet most are eager to get to the physical workplace. Koster was excited when he found iCIMS’ seating chart online. “I just found out where I’ll sit,” he said. For Guagenti it is all about getting face-to-face for coffee or a drink. “That’s where you develop trust,” he said."
564,Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak blasts Trump’s ‘reckless and selfish’ indoor rally,https://nypost.com/2020/09/13/nevada-gov-steve-sisolak-blasts-trumps-reckless-indoor-rally/,2020-09-13 00:00:00,"Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak blasted President Trump’s “reckless and selfish” decision to host an indoor campaign rally in the state on Sunday night amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Sisolak released a statement bashing Trump just ahead of the president’s 7 p.m. PST event in Henderson, which was expected to draw thousands of supporters — and to violate Nevada’s restrictions on gatherings of 50 people or more.
“President Donald Trump is taking reckless and selfish actions that are putting countless lives in danger here in Nevada,” Sisolak said in the statement.
“The President appears to have forgotten that this country is still in the middle of a global pandemic.”
The searing statement came after the president hosted a rally in Reno on Saturday night, and a “Latinos for Trump” roundtable in Las Vegas earlier on Sunday.
The Democratic governor said Trump was blatantly disregarding Nevada’s public health directives by holding the large indoor gathering, classified as “high-risk,” by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“He’s decided he doesn’t have to respect our State’s laws. As usual, he doesn’t believe the rules apply to him,” Sisolak said.
He called Trump’s actions “an insult to every Nevadan who has followed the directives, made sacrifices, and put their neighbors before themselves.”
“It’s also a direct threat to all of the recent progress we’ve made, and could potentially set us back,” Sisolak said.
He added: “At a time when Nevada is focused on getting our economy back on track and protecting public health, the President’s actions this weekend are shameful, dangerous and irresponsible.”"
565,Josh Kushner-linked startup axed staff three days before snagging PPP loan,https://nypost.com/2020/09/13/welkin-health-startup-cut-staff-three-days-before-ppp-loan/,2020-09-13 00:00:00,"A software startup backed by venture capitalist Josh Kushner axed about a third of its staff just three days before snagging coronavirus relief funds meant to help the firm preserve jobs, The Post has learned.
San Francisco-based Welkin Health laid off 10 of its roughly 30 employees on April 24 as the COVID-19 crisis sapped sales, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter.
Three days later, the health-care software provider was approved for at least $1 million from the Paycheck Protection Program, according to federal data — a forgivable loan meant to help small businesses keep people employed or rehire laid-off workers.
The April layoffs left Welkin with just about 20 employees, sources said — despite the company indicating to the Small Business Administration that it had 30 staffers, the data show.
The cuts that Welkin made before learning whether it had access to the job-saving cash go against the spirit of the $659 billion program created to protect workers during a historic economic crisis, says government watchdog Liz Hempowicz.
“The point wasn’t so that businesses could continue to exist on paper, or in a bank account,” Hempowicz, director of public policy at the nonpartisan Project On Government Oversight, told The Post. “It was so that people remained employed during this time of great economic instability.
“The practical effect here is that there’s less money in this program to go to those small businesses that do have those employees still working there,” she said.
Welkin has raised some $29 million from deep-pocketed investors in recent years, including from Thrive Capital — a venture fund run by Kushner, the husband of supermodel Karlie Kloss and younger brother of White House adviser Jared Kushner.
As The Post has previously reported, Thrive urged portfolio companies, including Welkin, to stay away from the PPP program meant for “for the smallest, most vulnerable businesses in our communities.”
“These loans are less obviously for the startup with a host of institutional investors and several years of cash in the bank, looking to extend runway,” Thrive wrote in an April 7 e-mail to startups that sought the fund’s advice on the PPP funds.
But Welkin defied Thrive’s advice, and blamed the April layoffs on the pandemic drying up its sales pipeline, sources said.
Now, sources say the layoffs could force the Silicon Valley company to pay back some of the loan instead of having it forgiven.
Companies that receive PPP money are supposed to spend 60 percent of it on payroll costs in order for the feds to convert the loan into a grant.
It could be tough for Welkin to clear that bar, said Hempowicz, because it’s “impossible” to pay people who’ve been axed.
And while PPP recipients have until Dec. 31 to rehire or replace laid-off workers and qualify for full loan forgiveness, Welkin doesn’t appear to have made any headway.
Several staffers have resigned since the layoffs, leaving the company with about 15 current employees, sources said. Welkin’s Web site had only one job listing as of Friday.
In response to The Post’s reporting, Welkin CEO Michelle Pampin said the company moved forward with the loan “after careful legal review to confirm our eligibility, as well as our review of the intent of the program in supporting small businesses.”
Pampin also said many data points and statements The Post presented were “inaccurate” but did not elaborate.
Welkin also axed roughly a dozen people a month prior to the COVID layoffs, on March 6, after losing its largest customer in February to a competitor, according to two sources.
At the time of the March cuts, Welkin VP of Finance Joe Oest told remaining staffers that the company had about “18 months of runway” and that no more layoffs were forthcoming, the sources said."
566,Israel to set new nationwide lockdown as virus cases surge,https://nypost.com/2020/09/13/israel-to-set-new-nationwide-lockdown-as-virus-cases-surge/,2020-09-13 00:00:00,"JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday announced a new countrywide lockdown will be imposed amid a stubborn surge in coronavirus cases, with schools and parts of the economy expected to shut down in a bid to bring down infection rates.
Beginning Friday, the start of the Jewish High Holiday season, schools, restaurants, malls and hotels will shut down, among other businesses, and Israelis will face restrictions on movement and on gatherings.
“Our goal is to stop the increase (in cases) and lower morbidity,” Netanyahu said in a nationally broadcast statement. “I know that these steps come at a difficult price for all of us. This is not the holiday we are used to.”
The tightening of measures marks the second time Israel is being plunged into a lockdown, after a lengthy shutdown in the spring. That lockdown is credited with having brought down what were much lower infection numbers, but it wreaked havoc on the country’s economy, sending unemployment skyrocketing.
The lockdown will remain in place for at least three weeks, at which point officials may relax measures if numbers are seen declining. Israelis typically hold large family gatherings and pack synagogues during the important fast of Yom Kippur later this month, settings that officials feared could trigger new outbreaks.
A sticking point in government deliberations over the lockdown was what prayers would look like during the holidays. While the details on prayer during the lockdown were not nailed down in the government decision, what were expected to be strict limits on the faithful. That prompted Israeli Housing Minister Yaakov Litzman, who represents ultra-Orthodox Jews, to resign from the government earlier Sunday.
Israel has had more than 150,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,100 deaths. Given its population of 9 million, the country now has one of the world’s worst outbreaks. It is now seeing more than 4,000 daily cases of the virus.
Israel earned praise for its initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak, moving quickly to seal the country’s borders and appearing to bring infections under control. It has since been criticized for opening businesses and schools too quickly and allowing the virus to spread unchecked.
Much of that criticism has been aimed at Netanyahu, who has faced a public outcry over his handling of the crisis and has seen thousands of protesters descend on his Jerusalem residence every week. While lauded for his decisive response following the spring outbreak, Netanyahu appeared distracted by politics and personal matters, including his trial for corruption allegations, as infections rose over the summer.
Netanyahu has also been lambasted for seeming to cave to pressure from various interest groups, including most recently his ultra-Orthodox governing partners, who appeared to have convinced him to relax a pinpointed, city-based lockdown plan that would have mostly affected ultra-Orthodox and Arab communities.
At the press conference Sunday announcing the lockdown, Netanyahu defended his response, saying Israel’s economy had emerged from the first lockdown in a better state than many other developed nations and that while cases were high, the country’s coronavirus mortality numbers were lower than other countries with similar outbreaks.
The country’s power-sharing government, made up of two rival parties who joined forces in a stated aim to combat the virus, has also been chided for the new outbreak. The government has been accused of mismanagement, failing to properly address both the health and economic crises wrought by the virus and leading the country to its second lockdown.
Some government ministers meanwhile have pointed fingers at what they’ve called an undisciplined public, who they have accused of violating restrictions against public gatherings and mask wearing."
567,Trump accuses Democrats of criticizing coronavirus vaccine for political purposes,https://nypost.com/2020/09/20/trumps-accuses-democrats-of-criticizing-coronavirus-vaccine-for-political-purposes/,2020-09-20 00:00:00,"President Trump on Sunday night said his Democratic opponents have been criticizing the speedy timeframe of a potential US coronavirus vaccine as a political move to harm him before the election.
“They want to denigrate it,” the president said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday night explaining the reaction from Democrats and some media outlets over a pending vaccine.
“This started about three weeks ago, because they started hearing rumors that we’re going to have this vaccine in super record time,” Trump told host Mark Levin.
Trump said the Democrats are claiming the vaccine “is coming out too soon” and are questioning its safety simply because they’re afraid the president will get credit ahead of the election.
“What they’re doing is trying to make it like ‘ah that’s not such a great deal.’ When actually, it’s one of the greatest things that anyone’s done,” Trump told Levin. “And I’m not saying me. I’m saying anyone. It’s so incredible, it’s so important.”
The president on Sunday night said that under a different administration a coronavirus vaccine would take up to three years “because of the FDA process.”
But Trump credited his administration with helping to achieve “record time” in vaccine development.
“I have totally changed the FDA process. Same safety, but the speed is from a different world,” he told Levin.
Trump added that a coronavirus vaccine is near completion.
The country is “right at the end of the process, really looking good and could be really early,” he said.
Last Friday, Trump said he expected the country would have doses available for “every American” by April."
568,Retailers anxious about socially distant Black Friday rush,https://nypost.com/2020/09/20/retailers-anxious-about-socially-distant-black-friday-rush/,2020-09-20 00:00:00,"Summer is barely over and US retailers are already fretting over the upcoming holiday shopping season amid fears that not even the coronavirus can keep Americans away from their favorite post-Thanksgiving pastime.
The industry is bracing for a 30 percent jump in brick-and-mortar traffic between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And while that would normally be a good thing, stores this year aren’t equipped to handle too many shoppers at once due to social-distancing requirements.
“We are hearing a lot of worry about the holidays,” said Gabriella Santaniello, president of A Line Partners, a retail research firm.
“How are we going to manage a rush of people” is the primary concern, she said.
Pandora, a popular shopping destination for charms and trinkets, is among the retailers concerned about holiday crowding at a time when it’s limiting store traffic to about 10 people at a time, including four or so sales associates.
“Our stores would not be able to handle the 30 percent greater customer traffic we expect between Black Friday and Christmas,” said Sid Keswani, president of Pandora’s North American operations. “While mall traffic is down, it’s still there.”
Aaron Sanandres, co-founder and chief executive of men’s shirt seller Untuckit, said he, too, fears the holidays could become unruly if shipping companies like UPS continue to be more burdened than usual thanks to the coronavirus.
If customers can’t get what they want in time for Christmas and Hanukkah, they will get in their cars and head to the mall, he said. “One very, very big question mark now is shipping, which could drive people to stores,” he said.
In an effort to curb the crowds, many stores will be doing away with traditional holiday sales tactics, including Black Friday doorbusters, late-night hours and free giveaways. People interested in a post-turkey dinner shopping excursion could have a hard time even finding a store that’s open as a growing number of retailers — Walmart, Target, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Kohl’s and Best Buy — have said they will keep their workers home Thanksgiving Day.
Black Friday hours will also be pared back. Empire Outlets of Staten Island, for example, plans to open at 8 a.m. on the day after Thanksgiving, said Travis Noyes, senior vice president of marketing for the outlet center overlooking the New York Harbor.
Last year, Empire Outlets’ 26 stores, including Nike Factory, H&M and Old Navy Outlet, opened for Black Friday at 11 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and stayed open all night through the next day until 10 p.m.
Holiday discounting won’t be gone entirely. But rather than condensing Black Friday into a single day or weekend, stores will spread it out over many weeks. Home Depot took this trend to a new level this month when it announced that its Black Friday deals would last two months starting in November.
Retailers will also do more online-only sales, said Kristin McGrath, editor of BlackFriday.com.
“We think retailers will use the terminology, but they’ll be online mostly,” McGrath said.
Pandora has been busy testing ways to reduce its lines to avoid frustrating customers this holiday season.
“We have found that people are willing to wait in line for 11 minutes — but not much longer than that,” Keswani said.
To help hasten the wait, the 300-store chain has set up 6-foot kiosks outside 10 of its stores, including at Garden State Plaza in Paramus, NJ. The kiosks are filled with bestsellers and gift sets that customers can buy without coming inside the store or waiting in line. A Pandora employee is stationed at the kiosk to handle the transaction.
People who choose to wait in line, meanwhile, will be handed a catalog to review to help hasten their decision-making process. Pandora is also rolling out a feature on its app that will allow customers to secure a place in line virtually.
Untuckit, which sells shirts designed to be worn untucked, has also been focused on a new online shopping tool that it hopes will help reduce foot traffic at its 87 stores this holiday season.
“When you pick a store, it will only show you the inventory at that store” to help customers avoid unnecessary shopping excursions, Sanandres said.
“We had this program in the works and thought we’d roll out in 12 to 18 months, but [the pandemic] accelerated it.”"
569,New York colleges flunked by experts for failure to report on COVID-19,https://nypost.com/2020/09/20/experts-flunk-local-ny-colleges-for-failure-to-report-on-covid-19/,2020-09-20 00:00:00,"Fordham, Long Island and Yeshiva universities get an “F” for keeping their communities in the dark on their coronavirus cases, a group of public-health experts says.
The Web site “We Rate COVID Dashboards’’ — founded by researchers including from Yale and Harvard universities — has been issuing “report cards’’ based on whether colleges have COVID-19 information dashboards, how frequently they report related data and how detailed the information may be, such as breakdowns between students and staffers.
Fordham, Long Island University, Yeshiva, Princeton and Johns Hopkins flunked for not having an adequate or even existing dashboard, the site said.
On the plus side, New York state’s Stony Brook University earned an A, as did Colgate, Vassar, Cornell, Brown, Harvard, Yale and Tulane.
The entire State University of New York system received a B+ for creating a central dashboard for its entire 64 campuses. The dashboard also provides links to results at each campus, including Stony Brook.
Meanwhile, Columbia University earned a B+, while New York University obtained a B grade.
One head-scratcher is Johns Hopkins University, which has a renowned Coronavirus Resource Center that tracks infections globally and nationally, with state-by-state breakdowns. It does not appear to have a dashboard for COVID-19 cases at its Baltimore campus, earning it an F from the rating group.
“We’re rating schools on transparency, the quality of the data and how they convey the information,” said Dr. Howard Forman, a Yale professor of health policy and radiology who co-founded the rating site, to The Post.
Ayotomiwa Ojo, a Harvard University medical student and chief researcher for “We Rate COVID Dashboards,” added, “It’s important these institutions are held accountable.
“Students, parents, college employees and local communities have a stake in information about COVID-19. Thousands of campus students are coming into their communities.”
But Fordham spokesman Bob Howe slammed the site’s `F’ grade of the Bronx-based university as “erroneous” because it does in fact have a COVID-19 dashboard that is significant. He said the site’s “research could use a little work” and has reached out to “We Rate Covid Dashboards” to change Fordham’s grade posted on September 17 after the Post contacted the school for comment.
Fordham’s COVID-19 Web site dashboard provides results at its Bronx Rose Hill and Manhattan Lincoln Center campuses on a 14-day rolling average and is shared on social media including Twitter. The figures show it has had 12 positive cases out of 3,649 students and staff tested, for an infection rate of 0.33.
Ojo said positive cases and infection rates should be updated every 48 hours.
LIU, Yeshiva and Princeton did not immediately respond to e-mail inquiries from The Post.
LIU does not appear to have a dashboard on its Web site but did provide a Sept. 15 update on COVID-19.
“Since the start of classes, [LIU’s] Post campus has five positive cases of individuals who have physically been on campus,’’ the school wrote at the time. “The Brooklyn campus has no positive cases of individuals who have physically been on campus but is aware of two individuals who have not been on campus this semester that have tested positive.’’
Coronavirus-specific information about infection rates at Yeshiva University could not be found on its Web site.
About 150 schools have been rated by the researchers so far.
“People are recognizing the importance of this information,” Forman said. “The colleges are following us. They care.”
Rapid disclosure of infections is particularly crucial at college campuses in New York, the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic with by far the most fatalities of any state in the country.
One state-university campus, SUNY Oneonta, already canceled in-person classes for the fall semester because of a coronavirus outbreak, and dozens of students have been suspended at a number of colleges for violating COVID-19 health safety rules.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has ordered the state Liquor Authority to target bars in college towns where students congregate to see if they are abiding by safety rules to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks.
Stanford University is an example of a school that went from worst to first on the researchers’ list.
The California school initially received an F grade for not having a COVID dashboard. It was then upgraded to an A after it recently posted a comprehensive dashboard, Forman said.
Forman said school officials have requested to be regraded after posting more COVID-19 data.
He said colleges have a public duty to provide comprehensive information about COVID-19 cases because the students and staff interact with people in the surrounding neighborhoods, which could lead to larger outbreaks."
570,How to watch and live stream Emmys 2020,https://nypost.com/2020/09/20/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-emmys-2020/,2020-09-20 00:00:00,"Somehow, it’s September. And the 2020 Emmy Awards are fast-approaching.
This year’s ceremony devoted to the best in television will be a little different — like most things — thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of an in-person ceremony held at the Microsoft Theater in downtown LA, stars will be broadcast into the show from around the world.
A promo for the award show promises 138 stars from 114 locations across 10 countries.
“How will we pull it off this year? We don’t know,” jokes host Jimmy Kimmel in a promo.
Though the show is still being billed as live, keep in mind that it’s a loose term for award shows this year. The VMAs, which were advertised as live, were mostly pre-filmed segments edited to seem in-the-moment.
Here’s everything you need to know about watching the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.
The Emmys air Sunday, September 20 at 8 p.m. EST, 5 p.m. PST on ABC.
ABC News Live will host a virtual preshow, “Countdown to the Emmys,” with a 90-minute special live streaming program hosted by “Good Morning America” Weekend co-anchors Eva Pilgrim and Whit Johnson and ABC News Correspondent Janai Norman from ABC News headquarters in New York. The pre-show will begin at 6:30 pm EST and will feature live interviews with nominees and much more.
In addition, Twitter will be hosting an exclusive Q&A with @TelevisionAcad for fans to ask their favorite Emmy nominees questions. Questions submitted by Sunday will be considered for the Emmys virtual Winners’ Walk, hosted by TV Academy Foundation alumnus Albert Lawrence.
The coronavirus has made traditional red carpet shows all but impossible, but the preshow will revisit some of the greatest fashion to grace Emmys red carpets of the past as well as give “a glimpse at this year’s ‘couch couture,'” according to ABC.
Jimmy Kimmel will take the “stage” once again. He previously helmed the show in 2012 and 2016.
Last year, the show famously went hostless on Fox.
Regina King, whose HBO show “Watchmen” carries the most nominations, should make an appearance as well as Rachel Brosnahan and the cast of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” which also received multiple nods.
ABC promises “additional surprises,” but revealed appearances from Anthony Anderson, Jason Bateman, Sterling K. Brown, Laverne Cox, D-Nice, America Ferrera, Morgan Freeman, Ilana Glazer, Abbi Jacobson, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Randall Park, Issa Rae, RuPaul, Patrick Stewart, Jason Sudeikis, Gabrielle Union, Count Von Count of “Sesame Street,” Lena Waithe, J.J. Watt, Oprah Winfrey, Ty Burrell, Ken Jeong, Mindy Kaling, Tatiana Maslany and Bob Newhart.
H.E.R. will be performing during the “In Memoriam” segment.
Those with cable can simply turn their TV to ABC to watch the three-hour-long broadcast.
Cord-cutters will have a more difficult time tuning in.
The ceremony can be streamed on Hulu with its live TV add-on, which can be purchased for $54.99 a month. A one-week free trial is available, just remember to cancel your subscription after the Emmys.
ABC is also available on YouTubeTV, which can be purchased for $64.99.
Sling and Philo do not carry ABC."

The Golden State has been under siege by wildfires that burned more than 3.4 million acres scorched so far this year, killed at least 26 people and destroyed numerous homes, CNN reported.
Parts of Southern California were ordered to evacuate Saturday as the Bobcat Fire in Los Angeles County quickly spread over 91,000 acres due to strong winds.
Meanwhile, toxic smoke from the wildfires has spread through California and nearby states, creating poor air quality conditions.
Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that access to the state’s mobile coronavirus testing sites has been impacted by air quality issues.
COVID-19 rates in the state have seen improvement in recent weeks, though the situation is not under control.
The seven-day average is now at 3,400 new cases, while the positivity rate is down to 3.6%, Newsom said.
“We are moving forward and seeing a decline in the rate of spread and transmission of Covid-19,” Newsom said, CNN reported.
And then on Friday, battle-weary Californians were rattled by a magnitude 4.6 earthquake outside of South El Monte near Los Angeles, according to the US Geological Survey.
“It’s a wake up call, reminds you that we do have earthquakes here. We have enough disasters going on right now, I’m like everybody else, I rather not have something else in 2020,” Lucy Jones, a seismologist with the California Institute of Technology, told news station KABC"
572,Emmys 2020’s COVID-era ceremony was a weird delight to watch,https://nypost.com/2020/09/20/emmys-2020-covid-era-ceremony-was-a-delight-to-watch/,2020-09-20 00:00:00,"Wait — was that a tribute to “Schitt’s Creek” or the 72nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards?
Sunday night’s first-ever virtual Emmys telecast went off with nary a hitch — and was transformed into a celebration of “Schitt’s Creek,” the Canadian-produced Pop TV sitcom that sailed away on an ocean of statuettes across several major categories — including awards for stars Catherine O’Hara, Eugene Levy, Daniel Levy and Annie Murphy (“Boop!”). Job well done for a series that deserved all the accolades. (Heck, it even won “two Peabody Awards . . . and a Soul Train Award,” host Jimmy Kimmel joked.) The cast accepted its awards, live, from Canada. Nice touch.
Speaking of Kimmel, he and the 2020 Emmys telecast’s home network, ABC, did nearly the impossible given the unprecedented circumstances. In short, they nailed it: No audience in the Staples Center? No problem. ABC used a “virtual audience” from last year’s telecast for Kimmel’s opening monologue, allowing the tuxedo-clad host a chance to riff to celebrity cardboard cutouts — save for “Ozark” star and Emmy nominee Jason Bateman, who showed up in-person (fully tuxed) to banter with Kimmel before walking out in faux disgust when Kimmel told him he’d “have to laugh” at his jokes during the “pand-Emmys.”
It was, in fact, a fun, entertaining way to watch a show in a genre that usually drags with too many congratulatory speeches and cringe-worthy banter between presenters. The in-person presenters, including Jennifer Aniston, Zendaya, Jason Sudeikis and Tracee Ellis Ross, kept it short and to the point. Even the winners were more entertaining, perhaps because they were in the comforts of their own homes, which personalized them more than usual. I could’ve done without the political posturing from some of the winners — but that was about the only familiar element in a very different telecast.
You would have been forgiven for thinking you weren’t watching Kimmel deliver a “Jimmy Kimmel Live” monologue — firing off a string of one-liners without missing a beat. “The only thing I’ll be producing when I’m 98 is phlegm,” he said, alluding to 2020 Emmy winner Norman Lear. On ABC being required to show the words “Schitt’s Creek” to assuage the censors: “Just in case you’re wondering why network television is dead: HBO can show a blue penis, no problem.”
A couple of questions: How cool was that alpaca that Randall Park brought on stage? Why didn’t Michael Douglas participate remotely from home (we only saw his photograph)? What the heck was up with Laverne Cox’s weird presenter speech? On a personal note, I was happy to see an onstage appearance from underrated “Barry” co-star Anthony Carrigan (a k a NoHo Hank), who appeared with Kimmel as a very Russian-sounding “Derek” the postman: “I started just before election day in 2016.” Funny stuff from a funny guy.
“Schitt’s Creek,” as already noted, won big, and it was nice to hear Daniel Levy thank fellow nominee Issa Rae (HBO’s “Insecure”). Very gracious. Levy on his many awards: “The Internet is about to turn on me, I’m so sorry.” The major “Schitt’s Creek” players were together, socially distanced, making it sweeter for father-and-son Eugene and Daniel to win their Emmys. Daniel was visibly emotional; Annie Murphy was wearing the sideways “A” necklace she wore as ditzy Alexis Rose. Nice touch, as were the everyday people — a schoolteacher in Florida, a UPS guy, a rancher in Montana, a truck driver, two physicians — reading the nominees in several categories.
HBO’s “Watchmen” also walked away with an armful of Emmys, which is no surprise given both its social timeliness and its success earlier this week at the Creative Arts Emmys. The network’s other show, “Succession,” also took home awards for Outstanding Drama and Lead Actor (Jeremy Strong).
Billy Crudup’s late-in-the-telecast Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series was nice, but fell short of what Apple TV+ had hoped for its flagship drama, “The Morning Show” (Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carrell also came up short).
Kimmel mentioned Friday’s passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to segue into the annual “In Memoriam” segment, which led off with Regis Philbin — appropriate, since Reege logged more hours on television than any other person in the history of the medium (surpassing Hugh Downs, who also died this year and who was noted in the segment). It hit all the right notes and, as far as I can tell, there were no egregious omissions. I think it would have been more powerful, though, with just orchestral accompaniment (instead of having H.E.R. sing along with photos of those who passed). It’s a minor quibble, but perhaps something to note for next year.
All in all, Sunday night’s telecast overcame huge technical and emotional obstacles, and many naysayers (“No way they can pull that off”), to present one of the most entertaining Emmys shows in recent memory — and, in the process, set a high bar for succeeding televised awards shows that will follow during these COVID-restricted times."

Ortiz said Friday that he was asymptomatic, but that his brother who was also infected had to spend a week in the hospital and lost 25 pounds (11 kilograms). Ortiz was speaking during the NESN broadcast of the Red Sox game against the New York Yankees on Friday.
“This is no joke,” Ortiz said. “You don’t realize how crazy this is until it hits home. And I learned so much about this COVID-19 thing while I was going through the process. It’s an experience to be honest with you.”"

A Kentucky infectious disease expert who forcefully led local calls to wear masks has died after a four-month battle against COVID-19.
Dr. Rebecca Shadowen, 62, had been a vocal advocate for mask-wearing from the very early stages of the coronavirus pandemic reaching the US, posting about it on social media, her family told NBC.
She was also a leading member of the Bowling Green-Warren County Coronavirus Workgroup when she fell ill herself in May, believing it came from an infected caregiver treating an elderly relative.
Even after she fell sick, Shadowen continued working for the local taskforce — repeatedly pushing for a local mask ordinance, colleagues at her workplace, the Medical Center at Bowling Green, told NBC.
“She’d say, ‘Look folks, this isn’t politics. This is science,'” Dennis Chaney, the medical center’s vice president of ancillary services, told NBC. “I heard her say that many times.”
During her four-month battle with the contagion — which at numerous times saw her on a ventilator and in ICU — she would continue to work from her hospital bed when lucid, her husband, fellow doctor David Shadowen, said.
“There were multiple times she thought she was turning the corner and we thought she was on the road to recovery,” he told NBC.
He was with Shadowen and their two adult children when his wife succumbed on Sept. 11, he said.
“A lot of kids think of their parents as heroes. Mine actually was,” her daughter, Kathryn, 23, told NBC.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear noted the doctor’s campaigning while saying he was “heartbroken” at the death of the “front line hero.”
“Please, follow Dr. Shadowen’s advice – wear a mask in her honor,” Beshear tweeted.

Strike one: his absurd vow that New York will do its own testing on any COVID-19 vaccine the feds approve.
Strike two: his bizarre threat to cut off funding for the city if he doesn’t like its NYPD reform plans — even as he also hits Mayor Bill de Blasio for not doing enough to stop spiking gun violence.
Strike three: his unhinged charge that the homicide of Breonna Taylor was “murder.”
Even sane-seeming moves look weird on closer examination: The gov named a committee of 20 to advise him on distributing any vaccine — but it’s stacked with his donors and labor cronies.
And it’s just nuts to say he’s assembling a panel of experts tasked with “double-checking” any Trump administration-approved vaccine for efficacy and safety. Sorry: The work on vaccines is all being done by professionals — some of whom would be sure to scream if politicians (insanely) tried to push a bad vaccine.
More, that double-check would cost money the state doesn’t have — and, presumably, delay vaccine distribution, too.
Worst, Cuomo fed anti-vax hysteria just so he could dump on the president and so score a point or two with Trump-haters.
He stooped to giving de Blasio another public wedgie at the same press conference, railing about the city’s worsening crime even as he reprimanded city leaders for failing to submit a police reform plan.
Hello: “Reforms” at the state and city level are driving the rise in violent crime — does he really demand more, when the NYPD is a national model of restraint?
But the lowest low was Cuomo’s decision to wade into the Breonna Taylor story with a slide saying her death was a “murder and where there’s a murder there are murderers.”
Murder? Heck, NBA analyst Shaquille O’Neal made the key point: “When you talk about murder, you have to show intent.” And no one rational thinks those Louisville cops intended to kill anyone the night they executed that search warrant.
You can argue they were in the wrong in how they proceeded — and you can certainly say (we do) that this shows reason to ban no-knock drug raids. But Cuomo’s chosen language is inexcusable for the governor of a state where cops are under siege.
The gov needs to take a week off from talking to the press (let his aides release the virus updates) and focus on figuring out how to plug the state’s $14.5 billion budget deficit. It may be boring, but at least then he’ll be putting out fires — not setting them."

The students are among now 21 at the school’s Westchester County campus in Pleasantville to have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past two weeks, Pace’s Web site said.
A total of 1,980 people have been tested at the campus so far, with a positive rate of 1.4 percent, school officials said.
The infections have led 225 people to be quarantined, the school said.
Eighteen of those infected live in Alumni Hall, the Pleasantville Daily Voice reported. 
There have been three reported cases on Pace’s Manhattan campus in the past two weeks and zero at its Haub Law school in White Plains, Westchester County, the university said."
577,Military suicides up as much as 20 percent during COVID-19 pandemic, https://nypost.com/2020/09/27/military-suicides-up-as-much-as-20-during-covid-19-pandemic/,2020-09-27 00:00:00,"Suicides among military members have spiked by as much as 20 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period last year, data shows.
Senior military officials say they believe that it’s difficult to pinpoint what’s driving the rise, though note that the timing coincides with the stateside outbreak of coronavirus.
Preliminary data had shown for the first three months of 2020 show a dip in military suicides across the active duty and reserves.
“I can’t say scientifically, but what I can say is — I can read a chart and a graph, and the numbers have gone up in behavioral health related issues,” Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told the Associated Press.
“We cannot say definitively it is because of COVID. But there is a direct correlation from when COVID started, the numbers actually went up.”
The jumps in suicide rates vary among the different branches of service.
Army officials said there was a 30 percent spike among active-duty Army members this year, while the Army Guard is up about 10 percent and the Navy’s rates are believed to be lower.
The Air Force saw suicides among active-duty and reserve members on par with the rate from last year — which was the worst in three decades for active-duty members in the branch.
Gen. Charles Brown, the Air Force chief, noted that pandemic-related stress could be playing a role in the numbers this year, which had also initially seen rates plummet before lockdowns began.
“COVID adds stress,” Brown said in a public remarks. “From a suicide perspective, we are on a path to be as bad as last year. And that’s not just an Air Force problem, this is a national problem because COVID adds some additional stressors – a fear of the unknown for certain folks.”
James Helis, director of the Army’s resilience programs, said that a combination of issues stemming from the pandemic — isolation, financial issues, remote schooling and loss of child care — had placed added stress on service members and their families.
“We know that the measures we took to mitigate and prevent the spread of COVID could amplify some of the factors that could lead to suicide,” Helis said.
Senior officials said they’re looking at changes such as potentially shortening deployments, which have increased because of two-week quarantine periods.
Gen. James McConville, the Army chief of staff, said there’s a new focus on “the time that they need to come back together and recover.”
“We were very focused on readiness four years ago because we had some readiness challenges, and we did a great job. The force is very, very ready now. But I think it’s time now to focus on people,” he told the AP.

Ron DeSantis lifted coronavirus restrictions on them and other businesses, according to a report.
Footage showed patrons overflowing out of the Elbo Room in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday after the governor’s surprise order, news station WPLG reported.
“I’m healthy, I’m strong and I feel comfortable with all my friends,” said Dan Gibby, who was at the watering hole.
In Davie, Gaffer’s Pub owner Debbie Qualls said the green light to reopen was a lifesaver for the business.
“We’ve had to pay the rent, the electric, all the bills. If it was too much longer, we wouldn’t be here,” Qualls said.
DeSantis’ announcement Friday allowed all bars and restaurants to reopen effectively immediately — and prevented local municipalities from implementing restrictions that would force them to operate at less than half-capacity unless that can be justified for health or economic reasons.
“We’re not closing anything going forward,” DeSantis said.
The governor closed bars and nightclubs on St. Patrick’s Day — March 17, 2020 — due to outbreaks across the state.
He said Friday the pandemic was not over, but it was time to restart the economy after six months of “people twisting in the wind.”
“We’ve been able to put a lot of people back to work over the last few months, and obviously we have more to do,” DeSantis said.
The Sunshine State has been a hotspot for COVID-19 with at least 700,000 confirmed cases, including at least 14,000 deaths, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University.

Footage shared to Instagram on Saturday night shows the Jamaican entertainer on stage hyping up what appeared to be hundreds of fans packed tightly at an undisclosed outdoor venue.
In another clip, fellow Jamaican vocalist Ikaya joined him on stage to serenade the concertgoers, many of whom were not wearing masks.
“No mask what happen [sic] to social distance have mercy on y’all soul,” wrote one user on a video of the tightly-packed crowd on promoter Steelie Bashment’s Instagram page.
Another added, “I will never attend any of these events because these promoters [are about] them and their money. We have to protect ourselves.”
Under the state’s COVID-19 guidelines, outdoor entertainment-related activities are only allowed to resume at 33% capacity and with six feet of distance between people.
It’s unclear where exactly the Brooklyn venue was located, but the events page advertised it as a “special, exclusive day party at a secret location” in the borough.
Daps also promoted the gig — which sold tickets starting at $50 — on his own Instagram page.
“NYC its been a long time,” he wrote. “Sept 26 + 27 I’ll be back on stage.”
Ikaya’s rep on Tuesday acknowledged that “hundreds of concertgoers” were in attendance, though claimed the event required masks, had limited tickets and provided hand sanitizer.
“Despite these efforts in place, a degree of responsibility rest with those in attendance and continuous efforts were taken to ensure compliance,” her rep said. “Though selective media footage might give the impression that this was not the case, we can categorically state that efforts were taken to ensure the safety of all the stakeholders.”
Her rep also claimed that the “secret” venue was not an attempt to flout coronavirus restrictions.
“As is current practice across entertainment circles, promoters tend to only reveal their venue location to ticket holders, as a means of ensuring and maintaining their stakeholder’s safety and security,” her rep said, but provided no further information about the venue."

“Sadly, there were 6 COVID fatalities yesterday,” he added.
A day earlier, the state recorded more than 1,000 positive COVID-19 tests for the first time since early June, although because of the total number of people reported tested Friday, the infection rate was still 1 percent. There also were four reported fatalities Friday and 527 people hospitalized."

A UK government science adviser warned Sunday that ongoing lockdowns just “defer the problem” — and warned that a third wave of the coronavirus next year is “entirely possible.”
Mark Woolhouse, who sits on Britain’s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), dismissed the UK’s latest lockdown as trying to “stick this out for another six months” in the vague hope a vaccine will become widely available.
“I have to say that most people I have talked to who are involved in vaccine development think that we may have a vaccine in six months, but it is doubtful that we will have been able to roll it out on a mass scale by that time,” he said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.
“So we are in a difficult situation for some months to come I am afraid,” he warned as a second wave devastates Europe.
Modeling suggests that a third wave is “entirely possible,” he warned.
“This is just another demo that lockdown doesn’t solve the problem, it defers it,” he said.
“That is why we need some kind of cavalry on the horizon or, alternatively, if we think that vaccine is not going to be available in six months, or 12 months or two years or whenever it may be, that we do need alternatives.”"
584,‘Emotional’ Nets talks sparked Joe Tsai’s $50M social justice fund,https://nypost.com/2020/09/27/emotional-nets-talks-sparked-joe-tsais-50m-social-justice-fund/,2020-09-27 00:00:00,"Despite the economic havoc brought on by the coronavirus, Nets owner Joe Tsai and his wife Clara have committed millions to social justice. Why? After talks with his players — intense, raw, emotional talks — he couldn’t not do it.
“The background is the Brooklyn Nets and the NBA. Since the killing of George Floyd, the country’s been thrown into kind of a turmoil. The teams and the team owners and players in the NBA have felt this very strongly,” Tsai said in a Zoom with students at Tsai CITY (Tsai Center for Innovational Thinking at Yale).
“The fact is [in] the NBA, we have a league where our elite players, our stars, 70 to 80 percent are black, and this is very, very personal to our players. And by extension, as we have our conversations with our players, I start to realize the issue of racial injustice is a deep-rooted problem with 400-plus years of history. Now, you can’t solve [it] overnight; but you have to face it directly. You have to face it now. You have to have that conversation. You can’t skirt it.”
So that’s what Tsai has done.
He and wife have vowed a $50 million Social Justice Fund for Brooklyn. The move was announced in August, but it was born out of some very emotional discussions with his Nets players over the past few months.
While Tsai wasn’t specific about exactly which Nets he spoke with, it’s clear that among the topics that hit home were racial profiling when it comes to policing.
With unarmed blacks three times likelier to be killed by police than whites, that reality hits home for Nets players. And they brought it home for Tsai, who called diversity the foundation of excellence, as important as the First Amendment.
“When I see a policeman on the streets, I don’t run away; there’s no fear. But as I have conversations with our players and also some friends — people that we know who are black — they start to pour out. … It’s a very, very emotional conversation,” said Tsai, emotional at times during the chat uploaded Friday.
“We’ve been in a lot of these emotional conversations about the kind of life that they lead that’s just different because certain people see other people by the color of their skin and not by what they do and what they accomplish.
“That’s why my wife and I started an initiative to say: We’re not only going to put money resources behind a social justice program but also look inward and look at our own organization. Are we diverse enough? Are we doing everything we can to promote the social justice cause, especially the issue facing the black community.”
Tsai also spoke about how becoming the Nets owner prompted him to join Twitter to communicate with fans, and how watching Yale lacrosse — for whom he played — win the 2018 NCAA title spurred him to take over the team in the first place. The Alibaba co-founder had bought a minority stake, but accelerated his takeover.
“The watershed moment was in 2018 when Yale lacrosse won the national championship. I went to the game and it was one of those moments where I thought to myself that a goal that nobody thought would be obtainable was actually achieved maybe a couple of years ahead of time,” said Tsai.
“So for me, I started to think how I want to structure my life, how to sort of re-plan my career or re-plan my life. I’d already gotten to a stage of relative success and comfort, and decided it was time for me to slow down a little bit at my work, my full-time job and start focusing on my family, start focusing on my passion which is I wanted to get into sports a little more. After that I bought the Brooklyn Nets.”"
585,SUNY campuses prepare for 25 percent cut in state aid amid pandemic,https://nypost.com/2020/09/27/suny-campuses-face-25-percent-cut-in-state-aid-amid-pandemic/,2020-09-27 00:00:00,"The coronavirus pandemic has exacted a heavy toll on New York’s public universities, which are bracing for a 25 percent cut in state operating aid on top of big revenue losses, The Post has learned.
The 64-campus State University of New York faces a revenue loss between $800 million to $1 billion for the 2020-21 academic year due to COVID-19’s impact on enrollment and other costs to keep campuses safe, a SUNY spokesperson said.
The campus president at the State University at Albany sent a Sept. 17 memo to his administration and faculty saying the campus is grappling with a $59 million deficit and that he anticipates the cut in state operating assistance this year.
“We have been informed to expect a 25% cut in state funding this year which is an $11.9 million loss. While reductions to state support are not yet official, we need to plan for these now, as our one-time cash reserves are being expended in their entirety this year,” said SUNY Albany president Havidan Rodriguez.
Rodriguez said the school has “instituted 15% budget-reduction targets for all divisions” and imposed a freeze on hiring and all but essential spending to generate $39 million in savings. He will tap into cash reserves to cover the rest of the shortfall.
One problem Albany U. has encountered during the pandemic is plummeting enrollment from out-of-state and international students. Unlike New York State residents, international students and out-of-state students are not eligible for state tuition relief and therefore pay most if not all of the sticker price for tuition and dorm costs that run roughly $32,000 per semester — a big source of revenue.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has imposed a travel advisory and a mandatory two-week quarantine on visitors to New York who hail from other states with rising coronavirus infection rates to prevent outbreaks here, which may have also impacted enrollment.
“This year we are seeing a 13% drop in out-of-state and a 47% decrease in international students. This represents a tremendous loss for our campus diversity, as well as creating a $4.8 million shortfall,” the president’s memo said.
Consequently, the number of students living in higher cost campus dorms has also cratered during the pandemic, Rodriguez said.
“The number of students living on campus this fall is approximately 4,000 — or 56% of capacity. The lost housing revenue is $29.2 million relative to what we planned for in our budget. The significant decline in on-campus student residents will also impact other operations (e.g., dining, retail, parking, etc.) where reduced fees will result in additional losses,” he said.
Meanwhile SUNY’s Stony Brook University president Maurie McInnis, in an open letter sent to the campus community last month said, “We have been told to expect a 20-30% cut in state funding this year, or $25 million. We also have been informed that our allocation for last year was retroactively cut – to the tune of $19 million.”
“It is unclear when, if ever, our funding will return to current levels, let alone the levels of support we would ideally receive as a top research institution in the region.”
She reported that Stony Brook has projected a $109.6 million shortfall for the current 2020-21 school — much of it tied to added COVID-19 costs for its state-supported hospital and medical school, which were busy treating coronavirus patients.
McInnis sent a follow-up notice last Thursday saying she has appointed five different budget study groups to realign Stony Brook’s finances for the long-term.
In her previous notice, she also suggested declining support from the state and the legislature’s resistance to raising tuition limits the research university’s options.
“An education at Stony Brook is remarkably affordable for a top research institution. While this is helpful for our families, there are consequences to having almost the lowest tuition in the AAU [Association of American Universities]. Increasingly, our dual commitments of affordability and excellence are becoming difficult to balance without robust state support or cohort-level tuition,” she said.
Absent additional emergency federal aid, a SUNY administration spokesperson said the 64-campus school as a whole faces a projected revenue deficit $800 million to $1 billion — in a $13 billion budget — due to the impact of COVID-19 on enrollment and the added costs to keep students and faculty safe.
But SUNY spokesman Holly Liapis said nothing is set in stone regarding state spending reductions.
“There have been no permanent spending reductions made and no targets set as the State has made clear it is awaiting clarity from Washington,” SUNY spokeswoman Holly Liapis.
For its part, Cuomo budget’s office said it is “preparing for the worst” if the federal government doesn’t provide a lifeline to state and local governments.
“For six months the State has waited for the federal government to deliver funding to offset a four-year, $62 billion revenue loss caused by the pandemic the federal government failed to stop, and we’ve neither made permanent spending reductions nor set specific reductions as we await clarity from Washington,” said Cuomo budget division spokesman Freeman Klopott.
“While hoping for the best, we are preparing for the worst, and we will continue to manage the State’s finances using the tools enacted by the State Legislature in a way that maintains a balanced budget while funding critical services.”
The state-funded City University of New York, which oversees 25 colleges in the five boroughs, had no immediate comment.
New York State’s 100 private colleges and universities are also facing headwinds and have warned they will hemorrhage students if the state scales back its tuition aid programs for low-and-moderate income students.
“If the federal government fails to provide necessary and adequate aid to states, New York State has suggested it will cut these programs by 20 percent cut. Were this to happen, countless students will be forced to make the difficult decision of whether or not they can continue their studies,”  Mary Beth Labate, president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, said in recent testimony before the Assembly Higher Education Committee."

Less than a week after head coach Jon Gruden violated the NFL’s mask mandate, which the league fined him $100,000 and the Raiders $250,000 for, the organization is now under investigation by the league for allowing unauthorized locker room access, according to ESPN.
The alleged violation came after Monday night’s 34-24 win over the New Orleans Saints. ESPN reports that an unauthorized team employee entered the Raiders’ locker room without the credentials to do so.
The NFL and the NFL Players Association, with help from state and federal committees, constructed strict regulations regarding access in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Only 40 employees in each organization are allowed to be in the locker room this season, according to the NFL policy distributed to all teams.
The league is expected to enforce this limitation and will impose discipline for violations, per ESPN.
Only players, coaching staff, athletic training staff, equipment staff, general manager and one member of the team’s public relations/communication department are permitted access to locker rooms this season."
587,"9/11 first responder, brother killed by coronavirus just 12 days apart",https://nypost.com/2020/09/27/9-11-responder-brother-killed-by-coronavirus-just-12-days-apart/,2020-09-27 00:00:00,"A pair of brothers from Queens, one a retired FDNY captain, shared a lifelong bond — and died from the coronavirus less than two weeks apart.
Nicholas and Ralph Gismondi were “big family men” who were so beloved that neighbors posted banners praising them when they succumbed to the pandemic, CNN said in a report Sunday.
Ralph Gismondi, 68, had retired from the fire department with the rank of captain and was among the first FDNY personnel to respond to the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Center, the network said.
He was working as a flight attendant for JetBlue airlines when he came down with a cough, fever, and shortness of breath on March 17.
Two days later, he and his wife Ann — who had known each other since they were teenagers — tested positive for the virus.
He died from complications from coronavirus on April 5.
“I could not have a funeral for him,” Ann Gismondi told CNN. “I did not have, you know, that closure. It was just a freaking nightmare.”
Nicholas Gismondi, 65, did not learn about his older brother’s death until he himself was hospitalized with the virus.
Known to friends as “Poppi,” Nicholas Gismondi was a standout baseball player at Monsignor McClancy High School before studying accounting.
His son, Christopher, told the outlet his dad was “someone who always wanted to turn life’s lemons into lemonade.”
Nicholas relocated to Westfield, NJ, three decades ago, becoming a pillar of the community that also earned him the name “Mr. Nick.”
“Volunteerism and giving back to the community were very important to him,” his wife, Mary Jane, told CNN.
On March 31, the couple came down with coronavirus symptoms and went to the hospital, where they were diagnosed.
Just 18 days later — 12 days after his brother’s death — he also died from the virus.
The siblings are survived by a sister and their parents, Nicholas, 96, and Josephine, 93."
588,Coronavirus battle shows the bravery of President Trump: Devine,https://nypost.com/2020/10/04/coronavirus-battle-shows-the-bravery-of-president-trump-devine/,2020-10-04 00:00:00,"President Trump is not a basement guy.
Sure, he could have done a Joe Biden and hidden in the White House the last five months, a president under quarantine cowering from the Chinese virus.
The symbolism would have been disastrous for the mightiest nation on the planet. Trump had to show fearlessness in the face of the virus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week called his refusal to kowtow to the coronavirus a “brazen invitation” to get sick.
But, as the president told his old friend Rudy Giuliani on Saturday afternoon, he took the risks he had to take, because “Great generals do not lead from behind. They get out front and motivate the troops.”
He was speaking to the former Big Apple mayor by phone from his hospital room at Walter Reed Medical Center, where he was flown by helicopter after his oxygen levels began to fall.
“I knew there was a risk that I could catch [the virus]. But if I couldn’t accept that risk, I should resign . . .
“I am the president of the United States. I can’t lock myself in a room . . . I had to confront it so the American people stopped being afraid of it so we could deal with it responsibly.
“I couldn’t hide in the White House . . .
“If I had handled it any other way, I would have created more panic, more fear in the American people . . .
“I’m going to beat this. Then I will be able to show people we can deal with this disease responsibly, but we shouldn’t be afraid of it.”
Giuliani, widely praised for his leadership during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, knows a thing or two about leadership. His staff urged him to retreat to safety in Brooklyn after the Twin Towers were attacked, but instead he went straight to Ground Zero.
“You can only lead from the front,” he says.
Trump reiterated the message Saturday night in a four-minute video from Walter Reed.
“This is America, this is the United States . . . This is the most powerful country in the world. I can’t be locked up in a room . . . As a leader, you have to confront problems.”
The fact is that a president doing his job and running for re-election necessarily is in contact with thousands of people. It’s not surprising he would contract the highly infectious coronavirus, regardless of precautions.
Biden’s timid behavior is not a model for how a president needs to behave. The obsessive measures taken to protect the 77-year-old border on fetishistic, with elaborate social distancing circles taped on the ground and masks at 20 paces. Staff yell, “Keep back!” and “Six feet.”
If this was your grandfather, you would appreciate the caution. But a president can’t be paralyzed by fear, and neither can the country.
The virus is no longer a death sentence. Treatments have been found, the fatality rate has plummeted and vaccines are on the horizon.
For political advantage, Democrats have tried to keep Americans scared, depressed and under house arrest, while blaming the president for every COVID death. Sensible Americans reject this perverse framing of the pandemic.
Maybe the basement option works for those in the media and protected classes who have jobs that allow them to sit at home and conduct business via Zoom.
But in order for them to eat and have their groceries delivered, somebody had to get out in the real world and risk the virus.
Those scolding the president and his supporters, tut-tutting about masks and social distancing, are sacrificing the welfare of children and young people who are least at risk.
For some, being cooped up inside is a death sentence worse than the virus.
We will see how the president, 74 and overweight, pulls through. But the signs are good, say his doctors, and he could be released from the hospital in the next couple of days.
Trump adapted to the virus. His rallies became open-air events at airports around the country, with the theatrical backdrop of Air Force One gleaming splendidly under klieg lights.
At his last rally, Saturday night at the Harrisburg airport in Pennsylvania, he stood out in the rain, valiantly performing in his wet suit for two hours.
The cheers were even more ecstatic than I remembered at his old indoor rallies, with a new chant of, “We love you.”
“I love the man because he cares about this country and he fights for us,” said attendee Teresa Tavoletti, a self-described “50-something suburban woman” who had driven from New Jersey.
“I don’t care how he speaks. I don’t care what he says. I care about his actions and his actions have proven it to me. He’s got a record now to prove that he cares.”
I heard the same from people across the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania. I saw it in Weirton, West Virginia, last weekend, at a gathering of 300 Trump supporters in a “Trump train,” a parade of vehicles and trucks waving Trump flags.
“He supports my livelihood, which is oil and natural gas,” said Jason Laster, 44, of Wellsburg, West Virginia. “He supports the right to bear arms. I just feel like he’s done great things for the country already. And, four more years, if we can get Pelosi to quit trying to impeach him, then I feel like he’s going to do a bunch more great things.”
You see the enthusiasm for the president outside Walter Reed, where stalwarts have gathered to wave flags outside his window and cars honk their horns in appreciation.
You see it in new voter registrations, from Florida to Pennsylvania and West Virginia, where Republicans are outstripping Democrats by as much as two to one.
If the president bounces back onto the campaign trail, he will be an invincible hero, who not only survived every dirty trick the Democrats threw at him, but the Chinese virus as well. He will show America we no longer have to be afraid.
Those who know Cardinal George Pell, the pope’s honest former finance minister, always suspected he had been set up when he was jailed on historic child sex abuse charges in his native Australia, and then acquitted on appeal.
Now bombshell reports in the Italian media allege that Pell’s fiercest foe at the Vatican, the recently fired Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu, wired 700,000 euros (about $822,000) from Vatican accounts to “recipients in Australia who helped ensure hostile testimony” during Pell’s trial in that country’s state of Victoria.
Before Pell flew back to Rome last week, he issued a statement from Sydney, one day after Becciu’s firing, hinting that the Vatican was involved in his malicious prosecution.
“The Holy Father was elected to clean up Vatican finances. He plays a long game and is to be thanked and congratulated on recent developments,” Pell’s statement said.
“I hope the cleaning of the stables continues in both the Vatican and Victoria.”
Stay tuned.
Mathematicians always hoped their field was the one human endeavor where reason would prevail over woke madness.
But no such luck. The Mathematical Association of America has succumbed.
“It is time for all members of our profession to acknowledge that mathematics is created by humans and therefore inherently carries human biases,” the MAA said in a statement.

Kellyanne Conway announced her own coronavirus diagnosis on Friday minutes after her daughter broke the news on the social media platform.
The elder Conway was at the Sept. 26 Rose Garden event for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. There were roughly 150 high-profile guests in attendance at the event, many without masks.
At least eight people who attended the event have contracted the virus.

591,Queens karaoke bar shuttered for third time in a month over COVID-19 violations,https://nypost.com/2020/10/04/queens-karaoke-bar-shuttered-for-third-time-over-covid-19-violations/,2020-10-04 00:00:00,"They’re really causing treble.
A Queens karaoke joint was busted early Sunday for flouting New York’s coronavirus laws — for the third time in a month, authorities said.
New York City Sheriff’s Office deputies rushed WeGo KTV on Union Street and Northern Boulevard in Flushing around 2:40 a.m. and found some 40 people hiding inside, many without face masks.
The revelers were escorted out and deputies handed out masks before shuttering the business, the sheriff’s office said.
At least 13 people, including two managers, were issued numerous summonses for violating safety regulations regarding social distancing and indoor dining amid the pandemic.
Deputies, acting on a tip that the joint was breaking COVID-19 laws yet again, had set up surveillance outside the establishment at around 9 p.m. on Saturday — and saw 20 people going inside between 9:45 p.m. and around midnight before they raided the bar.
An employee at the sing-along spot had been letting patrons in through the front door and then locking it behind them, meaning they wouldn’t have been able to escape in the event of a fire or other emergency, the sheriff’s office said.
In addition to the large group of partiers, deputies also found wine, beer and liquor stashed in karaoke rooms and storage spaces — despite the fact that the bar had its liquor license pulled last month.
Inspectors visiting on Sept. 4 — following several 311 complaints about loud music — found six patrons in the lobby and a crowd of more than 100 on the third floor and pulled the establishment’s license.
Two people were arrested for possession of ketamine and were each issued criminal court summonses.
But that didn’t stop WeGo KTV from keeping the party going. On Sept. 19, deputies said they discovered 75 people inside the joint, including many who were drinking, smoking and not wearing masks.
Authorities also found party rooms filled with booze and food, plus an inventory of alcohol, 23 packs of untaxed cigarettes and three bladed weapons.
Two people were arrested during that raid on a slew of charges, including breaking coronavirus rules, and then released after being issued desk appearance tickets.
The sting on Sunday marked at least the city’s sixth in under a month against a karaoke bar for COVID-19 violations — four more have been raided in Flushing, including the The Platinum Lounge on Friday night, and another in Borough Park, Brooklyn."

The commander-in-chief, wearing a mask, waved to supporters from the rear passenger seat of a black Chevy Suburban, shortly after tweeting a video in which he promised a “little surprise visit” to the crowd.
“I also think we’re gonna pay a little surprise to some of the great patriots that we have out on the street,” said Trump in the video, published moments before the unannounced drive-by. “They’ve been out there for a long time and they’ve got Trump flags and they love our country.
“I’m not telling anybody but you, but I’m about to make a little surprise visit.”
Following the brief spin, Trump returned to his suite at the Bethesda, Md., hospital, where he was admitted on Friday less than 24 hours after he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the contagion.
“It’s been a very interesting journey,” said Trump in the video. “I learned a lot about COVID. I learned it by really going to school. This is the real school. This isn’t the ‘Let’s read the book’ school.
“I get it. I understand it, and it’s a very interesting thing, and I’m going to be letting you know about it.”
Trump’s medical team said earlier Sunday that the president — who, according to senior members of his re-election team, is eager to get back out on the stump — could be discharged to the White House as early as Monday.

The commander-in-chief remains hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center — at least until Monday — but has been discussing the race via phone with campaign honchos.
“Once he gets out of the hospital, he’s ready to get back to the campaign trail,” senior campaign advisor Jason Miller told Chuck Todd, host of “Meet the Press” on NBC. “He sounded pretty energetic.”
Steve Cortes, also a senior advisor on the campaign, told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” that it would only be a matter of time before Trump was back on the stump.
“He was as upbeat and assertive as he’s ever been,” said Cortes, describing a Saturday phone call between Trump and senior campaign staff. “This president is going to recover.”
“He said, ‘We are going to win this campaign,’ ” continued Cortes, before borrowing a baseball analogy. “He’s on the DL [disabled list] right now, but very, very shortly he’s going to be back in the game throwing 95 mile-an-hour fastballs. You can count on that.”
In Trump’s stead, members of his family will hold virtual campaign events, and Vice President Mike Pence will hit the road this week, according to Miller.
“He’s gonna have a very full, aggressive schedule, as will the first family,” he said on “Meet the Press.”"
594,"Biden leads by 10 points, majority say Trump could’ve avoided COVID-19: poll",https://nypost.com/2020/10/04/biden-leads-by-10-points-majority-say-trump-couldve-avoided-covid-19-poll/,2020-10-04 00:00:00,"NEW YORK — Democrat Joe Biden opened his widest lead in a month in the US presidential race after President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, and a majority of Americans think Trump could have avoided infection if he had taken the virus more seriously, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday.
The Oct. 2-3 national opinion poll gave little indication of an outpouring of support for the president beyond Trump’s core group of followers, some of whom have gathered outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where the president has been hospitalized.
Trump has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the pandemic as something that would disappear on its own, chiding Biden as recently as last week for wearing a protective mask, even as the coronavirus infected millions of people and forced businesses and schools to close.
Among those adults who are expected to cast ballots in the Nov. 3 election, the poll found that 51% were backing Biden, while 41% said they were voting for Trump. Another 4% were choosing a third-party candidate and another 4% said they were undecided.
Biden’s 10-point edge over Trump is 1 to 2 points higher than leads Biden posted over the past several weeks, though the increase is still within the poll’s precision limits of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
With about a month to go before the election, Biden has maintained an early advantage in securing the national popular vote. But to win the presidency, a candidate must prevail in enough states to win the Electoral College, and state polls show that Trump is nearly as popular as Biden in battleground states.
Trump, 74, was transferred to Walter Reed on Friday, hours after tweeting that he was diagnosed with COVID-19. The announcement set off a dizzying split-screen experience for many: as media alerts lit up cell phones and television chyrons about Trump feeling feverish and needing oxygen, several other Republican leaders who had been in close proximity with the president announced that they, too, had tested positive.
Most Americans continue to be deeply worried about the virus, and the poll found that 65%, including 9 in 10 registered Democrats and 5 in 10 registered Republicans, agreed that “if President Trump had taken coronavirus more seriously, he probably would not have been infected.”
Only 34% said they thought that Trump has been telling them the truth about the coronavirus, while 55% said that he was not and 11% were unsure.
Of those polled, 57% of Americans said they disapproved of Trump’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic overall, up about 3 points from a poll that ran late last week.
Americans also appear to be largely supportive of curtailing the 2020 presidential race to ensure everyone’s safety.
Sixty-seven percent of Americans want to stop in-person campaign rallies and 59% think the presidential debates should be postponed until Trump recovers from the coronavirus.
It is unclear at this point how Trump’s diagnosis will impact the next presidential debate, which is scheduled for Oct. 15. The first vice presidential debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Mike Pence is scheduled for Thursday.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,005 US adults, including 596 likely voters.
Only about 61% of voting-age Americans actually voted in the 2016 election."

“We’re in a campaign,” Miller told “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd on NBC when asked whether it would be prudent to move the contests online.
“We have a month to go,” he said. “We see Joe Biden and [Biden’s running mate] Kamala Harris out there campaigning. Certainly, they’re not asking for a remote debate.”
Miller also dismissed questions about whether Vice President Mike Pence — who has tested negative for the virus — should limit his exposure to people by staying off the campaign trail with Trump laid up at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
“I have no concerns at all,” he said. “The vice president takes very serious all of these measures. Anyone around the vice president are tested, people are kept very safe.
“And again, we can’t hide from this virus forever, Chuck. We have to take it head-on.”
Two days after a messy Tuesday night debate with Biden in Cleveland that saw the candidates skip handshakes and stay six feet apart as a medical precaution — Trump tested positive for the contagion.
A test on Biden came back negative.
Pence and Harris are still set to debate Wednesday night in Salt Lake City, though under additional precautions.
Trump and Biden still have two debates on the schedule — Oct. 15 in Miami and Oct. 22 in Nashville.
Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Biden, told George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week” that he too was open to the debates continuing as scheduled, so long as proper health precautions are taken and Trump’s health permits.
“We send President Trump our best. We hope that he is well and able to debate,” Bedingfield said Sunday. “If he is, Joe Biden will certainly be there.”"

The long line of cars, trucks and motorcycles had mostly driven into the city from Long Island — grinding traffic to a halt for at least 30 minutes as they arrived to loudly cheer for the president outside his Trump Tower home.
They constantly blared horns and waved flags — with loud chants of “Four more years!” in support of the commander-in-chief’s re-election bid.
The noise stopped for at least a moment as the group called for a moment of silence to send a prayer.
“This is a serious situation — the leader of the free world is sick. The leader of the free world needs our support,” an organizer said over a loudspeaker, asking those gathered to “send some good energy to President Trump.”
After the silence, he shouted, “President Trump, we love you!” — before leading the group in chants of “USA! USA!”
There were no arrests for blocking traffic — despite police cracking down on Black Lives Matter protesters and anti-eviction advocates for blocking traffic in recent weeks.
“There were a lot of cops [but] there was no trouble,” said a local security guard, who estimated she saw the caravan blocking Fifth Avenue almost 10 blocks from 54th Street to around 62nd Street. “It was peaceful, no stress. Nobody was hassling anybody,” she said of the loud show of support.
As many took to the streets outside Trump Tower, there was also virtually no sign of any masks, either — despite the pandemic that brought them there to show support for the president after his hospitalization.
The main group — suitably called “The Long Island Loud Majority” — had gotten up around 4 a.m. to gather in Ronkonkoma and head to the city, according to one of those involved, Jessica Marie Hahnan.
“I felt the love and energy today,” the 28-year-old Trump supporter from Farmingdale told The Post of the “prayer vigil” for POTUS and FLOTUS.
“Today the energy was electric. It was amazing — no chaos, no [middle] fingers, no drama, just supporting our president and our [men and women in] blue,” she said.
Hahnan said being at Trump Tower felt “sentimental” because “we were praying for him.”
“I’m praying for every single person in this world … including President Trump, the first lady and the whole administration,” she said.
“I pray that my country comes together because we are divided right now. We should be standing together praying for our president and our first lady. He is still a human being. He is 74 years old,” she said, noting how his age put him in the high-risk group for the disease.
Hahnan said she did not vote in the last election, but is now throwing her support behind the president because “he kept his promises.”
“I’m middle class. He helped my family and a lot of people. My dad is a union worker and his 401(k) has tripled,” she said. “I think he is doing a good job.
“I know he has so many plans for this country to get back on its feet.”
Since Trump confirmed early Friday that he had tested positive for COVID-19, there have been a number of rallies in support — including outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where the commander-in-chief remained Sunday for ongoing treatment.
“Thank you so much!,” Trump wrote on Twitter, linking to a posting from Dan Scavino, the White House social media director."

As part of his coronavirus treatment, President Trump is now receiving the steroid dexamethasone, his doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center revealed Sunday.
“In response to transient low oxygen levels … we did initiate dexamethasone therapy, and he received his first dose of that yesterday,” said Dr. Brian Garibaldi during a press briefing outside the facility. “Our plan is to continue that for the time being.”
The president is receiving that treatment in addition to a course of Remdesivir, an experimental but promising antiviral drug.
Dexamethasone is a widely available steroid commonly used to treat everything from edema to eye inflammation to autoimmune diseases and cancers including leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
In June, dexamethasone was found by British researchers to be effective in treating severely ill COVID-19 patients, reducing death rates by around a third among those in need of assisted breathing or supplemental oxygen.
The National Institutes of Health, however, has recommended against the drug’s use on patients with milder cases of the virus.
Trump’s medical team has observed two instances of the president’s blood-oxygen saturation declining and administered supplemental oxygen, but said Sunday that he is on the mend and may be discharged as early as Monday."
599,De Blasio wants NYC to shut down COVID-19 hot spots starting Wednesday,https://nypost.com/2020/10/04/de-blasio-wants-nyc-to-shut-down-covid-19-hot-spots/,2020-10-04 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday he wants to send the city’s COVID-19 hot-spot neighborhoods into lockdown again starting Wednesday — shutting down all of their non-essential businesses, public and private in-school learning and indoor and outdoor restaurant dining.
Kids in the nine neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens could still attend school for the next two days before going all remote Wednesday, de Blasio said — while houses of worship will remain open.
“We’re having an extraordinary problem — something we haven’t seen since spring,’’ de Blasio told reporters on a conference call, referring to the uptick in the coronavirus in those areas.
About a half-million people would be affected by the return to the kind of drastic shut-down that the city hasn’t seen since one was instituted in mid-March.
The move would shut down in-classroom learning for 100 public schools and another 200 private schools, the mayor said.
Restaurants would still be allowed to offer take-out and pick-up orders.
Meanwhile, another 11 neighborhoods in the city are on a “watch list’’ over their COVID-19 numbers  — and would lose indoor dining and have their gyms and pools closed starting Wednesday morning under the city’s push.
The 11 zip codes could end up going into full lockdown, like the most worrisome nine zip codes, if their numbers don’t improve, the mayor warned.
He noted that such regional lockdowns “will require the support and approval of the state’’ and that city will be holding “intensive’’ talks with the administration of Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the next day over the issue.
“This can only happen with state approval,’’ the mayor said. “We’ll be working to get approval.”
A rep for Gov. Cuomo, asked by The Post for a response to de Blasio’s push, only repeated what the governor told reporters in his own conference call earlier in the day about cracking down on scofflaws in the hot zones.
“The state cannot take over effective enforcement for every jurisdiction, and if a local jurisdiction cannot or will not perform effective enforcement of violating entities, notify the state, and we will close all business activity in the hot spots where the local governments cannot do compliance,’’ Cuomo said in the e-mailed statement.
He said the state will be doing its own “aggressive enforcement” starting tomorrow.
Cuomo added that if “localities do not do testing immediately in the schools in those [COVID-troubled] areas, the state will close them immediately.’’
His office did not respond to questions about the extent of the testing the state is demanding, including who would have to undergo it and how often.
New York City currently mandates only random monthly testing of students, teachers and other building workers.
De Blasio said he hopes to keep the neighborhood lockdowns to a “brief duration … two to four weeks.’’
The move was prompted by the fact that the nine zip codes showed virus infection rates at 3 percent or above for at least seven consecutive days, the mayor said.

President Trump “continues to improve” and could be discharged from the hospital as early as Monday and return to the White House as he continues to undergo further treatment for COVID-19, his doctors said Sunday.
“He has been up and around. Our plan today is to have him eat and drink, be up out of bed,” Dr. Brian Garibaldi, a member of Trump’s medical team, said outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,.
“If he continues to look and feel as well as he does today our hope is to plan for a discharge as early as tomorrow to the white house where he can continue his treatment course.”
Dr. Sean Dooley added that the president “continues to improve” and “has remained without fever since Friday morning.”
“His vital signs are stable. From a pulmonary standpoint, he remains on room air this morning and is not complaining of shortness of breath or other significant respiratory symptoms,” said Dooley.
The doctors also said the commander-in-chief experienced two episodes in which his oxygen levels dropped and were countered with drug therapy and supplemental oxygen.
“Thursday night into Friday morning when I left the bedside, the president was doing well with only mild symptoms and his oxygen was in the high 90s,” Dr. Sean Conley told reporters.
“Friday morning when I returned to the bedside, the president had a high fever and his oxygen saturation was transiently dipping below 94 percent,” he said.
Conley said because of the developments, he became “concerned for possible rapid progression of the illness” and administered dexamethasone.
“I recommended to the president that we try supplemental oxygen and see how he’d respond. He was fairly adamant he didn’t need it. He was not short of breath. He was tired, had a fever, that was about it,” Conley said.
“After about a minute — on only two liters — his saturation levels were back over 95 percent. He stayed on that for about an hour maybe, and was off and gone. Later that day by the time the team here was at the bedside, the president had been up out of bed moving about the residence with only mild symptoms,” he said.
At that point he said the medical team agreed the president should leave the White House for Walter Reed.
Along with the dexamethasone, a steroid, Trump is receiving Remdesivir and a cocktail of antibodies while being treated at the hospital.
Conley was asked why the medical team hadn’t disclosed during Saturday’s briefing that the president had been administered oxygen.
“I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude of the team, that the president, that his course of illness has had. Didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction,” Conley said. “And in doing so, came off like we’re trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true. The fact of the matter is that he’s doing really well.”
Conley was asked whether Trump, because of the dropping oxygen levels, showed signs of pneumonia or other lung problems associated with people battling coronavirus. “So we’re tracking all of that. There’s some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern,” he said.
Pressed on the president’s lung functions, Conley said they performed a lung spirometry on Trump.
“He’s maxing it out. We told him to do what you can do, and it’s over 2500 milliliters each time. He’s doing great,” Conley said.
He also addressed the inconsistencies between the doctors’ rosy assessment of Trump’s condition during Saturday’s briefing and comments made later by White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that the physicians were “very concerned” with the president’s fever and oxygen levels.
“I think his statement was misconstrued. What he meant was that 24 hours ago when he and I were checking on the president, that there was that momentary episode of the high fever and that temporary drop in the saturation, which prompted us to expediently to move him up here,” Conley said.
But he said that was a “transient-limited episode” and the president was back up shortly afterward.
“We’re not going to speculate what that limited episode was about so early in the course, but he’s doing well,” Conley said."

Fox News’ anchor Chris Wallace and an adviser to the Trump reelection campaign got into a tense exchange Sunday over the president’s family sitting in the first row at Tuesday’s presidential debate without wearing masks.
Wallace, who moderated the debate in Cleveland that turned into a free-wheeling 90 minutes of insults and interruptions between President Trump and Joe Biden, asked Steve Cortes why Trump’s family flouted the rules set up by the Cleveland Clinic — to which Cortes replied that they had already been tested for COVID-19.
“Do they think that the health and safety rules for everybody else do not apply to them?” he questioned on “Fox News Sunday.”
“Everybody was tested before that event, as you well know,” Cortes replied.
“It doesn’t matter. Everybody that was in that room was tested and the Cleveland Clinic’s regulation was that it didn’t matter,” said Wallace, adding that only he, the president and Biden were exempt from the mask-wearing regulations.
Trump is receiving treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center after he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday.
Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has tested negative.
Wallace pointed out images showing the Trump family — Eric, Donald Jr., Ivanka, Tiffany and the first lady — not wearing facial coverings, along with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.
He added that officials from the Cleveland Clinic approached the family and offered to give them masks, but were waved away.
“So forget this question of being tested beforehand. Everybody was tested beforehand. That — no, I’m going to finish my question — everybody was told to wear a mask, why did the first family and the chief of staff feel that the rules for everybody else didn’t apply to them?” Wallace pressed.
“Chris, we believe the masks are very useful. The president has worn them on many occasions,” Cortes said.
“We also believe in some element of individual choice. People were distanced, and they had been tested, both of those things were true,” he said.
But Wallace immediately shot back.
“They weren’t distanced and there were rules and there was no freedom of choice. They broke the rules, why did they break the rules?” the Fox News host pressed.
After a few more moments of back-and-forth between the two, Cortes brought up Wallace’s moderating duties at the debate.
“The way you’re starting to harangue me now actually reminds me of what you did to the president. He had to debate not just Joe Biden but you as well. You were not a neutral moderator then,” Cortes said before going on to call Wallace the “effective opposition to the president.”
“People can make reasonable decisions for themselves,” Cortes said.
“No, actually they can’t, they’re the rules and they’ll be kicked out next time,” Wallace countered. “The president interrupted me and the vice president 145 times, so I object to saying I harangued the president, I know it’s the talking point.”"

The Titans’ Week 4 COVID-19 problem could soon become a Week 5 problem and has the NFL investigating how it all went awry.
As the Titans’ coronavirus outbreak grew to 18 on Sunday — with an additional player and staff member testing positive, according to multiple reports — the league and its players association are in Nashville looking into whether the team violated protocols, ESPN reported.
“This isn’t a failure of the protocols; it is a failure to follow the protocols,” a source told ESPN.
Officials could be looking to “make an example” out of the Titans, according to the report, after asking them to turn over video of team activities to see how the virus may have spread. But the organization believes it has complied with the protocols, ESPN reported, perhaps even better than some other teams in the league.
But to date, the Titans have the NFL’s only outbreak. The Falcons had one player test positive before their game last weekend but have had no other cases. Patriots quarterback Cam Newton tested positive, leading to a postponement of Sunday’s Patriots-Chiefs game, but the rest of the team returned negative tests on both Saturday and Sunday, ESPN reported.
The Titans’ first positive case came last week with outside linebackers coach Shane Bowen. The list began to grow on Tuesday with players and other staff members testing positive, leading to the NFL postponing their Sunday game against the Steelers.
Now, with a steady trickle of positive cases continuing to come in, their facility will be closed until at least Wednesday, per ESPN, and any more could put their Week 5 game against the Bills in danger."
603,Pope Francis says market capitalism has failed amid COVID-19 crisis,https://nypost.com/2020/10/04/pope-frances-says-market-capitalism-has-failed-amid-covid-19/,2020-10-04 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
ROME — Pope Francis says the coronavirus pandemic has proven that the “magic theories” of market capitalism have failed and that the world needs a new type of politics that promotes dialogue and solidarity and rejects war at all costs.
Francis on Sunday laid out his vision for a post-COVID world by uniting the core elements of his social teachings into a new encyclical, “Fratelli Tutti” (Brothers All), which was released on the feast day of his namesake, the peace-loving St. Francis of Assisi.
The document draws its inspiration from the teachings of St. Francis and the pope’s previous preaching on the injustices of the global economy and its destruction of the planet and pairs them with his call for greater human solidarity to address today’s problems.
In the encyclical, Francis rejected even the Catholic Church’s own doctrine justifying war as a means of legitimate defense, saying it had been too broadly applied over the centuries and was no longer viable.
“It is very difficult nowadays to invoke the rational criteria elaborated in earlier centuries to speak of the possibility of a ‘just war,’” Francis wrote in the most controversial new element of the encyclical.
Francis had started writing the encyclical, the third of his pontificate, before the coronavirus struck and upended everything from the global economy to everyday life. He said the pandemic, however, had confirmed his belief that current political and economic institutions must be reformed to address the legitimate needs of the people most harmed by the coronavirus
“Aside from the differing ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident,” Francis wrote. “Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.”
He cited the grave loss of millions of jobs as a result of the virus as evidence of the need for politicians to listen to popular movements, unions and marginalized groups and to craft more just social and economic policies.
“The fragility of world systems in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated that not everything can be resolved by market freedom,” he wrote. “It is imperative to have a proactive economic policy directed at ‘promoting an economy that favors productive diversity and business creativity’ and makes it possible for jobs to be created, and not cut.”
He denounced populist politics that seek to demonize and isolate, and called for a “culture of encounter” that promotes dialogue, solidarity and a sincere effort at working for the common good.
As an outgrowth of that, Francis repeated his criticism of the “perverse” global economic system, which he said consistently keeps the poor on the margins while enriching the few. Francis rejected the concept of an absolute right to property for individuals, stressing instead the “social purpose” and common good that must come from sharing the Earth’s resources.
Francis once again rejected “trickle-down” economic theory as he did in the first major mission statement of his papacy, the 2013 Evangelii Gaudium, (The Joy of the Gospel), saying it simply doesn’t achieve what it claims.
“Neo-liberalism simply reproduces itself by resorting to magic theories of ‘spillover’ or ‘trickle’ — without using the name — as the only solution to societal problems,” he wrote. “There is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged ‘spillover’ does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of violence threatening the fabric of society.”
Much of the new encyclical repeats Francis’ well-known preaching about the need to welcome and value migrants and his rejection of the nationalistic, isolationist policies of many of today’s political leaders.
He dedicated an entire chapter to the parable of the Good Samaritan, saying its lesson of charity, kindness and looking out for strangers was “the basic decision we need to make in order to rebuild our wounded world.”
He enshrined in the encyclical his previous rejection of both the nuclear arms race and the death penalty, which he said was “inadmissible” in all cases.
“All Christians and people of good will are today called to work not only for the abolition of the death penalty, legal or illegal, in all its forms,” he said.
Francis’ call for greater “human fraternity,” particularly to promote peace, is derived from his 2019 joint appeal with the grand imam of Egypt’s Al-Azhar, the revered 1,000-year-old seat of Sunni Islam. Their “Human Fraternity” document established the relationship between Catholics and Muslims as brothers, with a common mission to promote peace.
The fact the he has now integrated that Catholic-Muslim document into an encyclical is significant, given Francis’ conservative critics had already blasted the “Human Fraternity” document as heretical, given it stated that God had willed the “pluralism and diversity of religions.”
Vatican encyclicals are the most authoritative form of papal teaching and they traditionally take their titles from the first two words of the document. In this case, “Fratelli Tutti” is a quote from the “Admonitions,” the guidelines penned by St. Francis in the 13th century.
The title of the encyclical had sparked controversy in the English-speaking world, with critics noting that a straight translation of the word “fratelli” (brothers) excludes women. The Vatican has insisted that the plural form of the word “fratelli” is gender-inclusive.
Francis’ decision to sign the document in Assisi, where he traveled on Saturday, and release it on the saint’s feast day is yet further evidence of the outsized influence St. Francis has had on the papacy of the Jesuit pope.
Francis is the first pope to name himself after the mendicant friar, who renounced a wealthy, dissolute lifestyle to embrace a life of poverty and service to the poor."

The former vice president had shared a debate stage with President Trump on Tuesday, and tested negative as recently as Friday, his campaign has said.
But the median incubation period for the virus is five days, and tests can come back negative for newly infected people who aren’t yet shedding enough virus to detect, experts say.
Biden will get a test every time he travels, according to his campaign, which promised to increase transparency around his testing following Trump’s infection with the virus, The Washington Post reported.
“We have adhered to strict and extensive safety practices recommended by public health experts and doctors in all of our campaigning — including social distancing, mask wearing, and additional safeguards,” campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.
“Vice President Biden is being tested regularly, and we will be releasing the results of each test.”
Biden has said Friday that he and his wife, Jill, had tested negative for the virus.
He told reporters he plans on getting tested again on Sunday morning before traveling to Florida on Monday, CNN reported.
Trump’s positive test had initially sparked health fears for Biden, who shared a stage with the president for 90 minutes Tuesday night.
The event was indoors but their podiums were spaced just over 12 feet apart.
Biden plans to continue campaigning in person as Trump fights the virus in Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
He campaigned in Wilmington, Del., on Saturday.
His team announced it will pull negative ads against the president for the time being, though Biden has remained critical of the White House’s handling of the pandemic.
“It’s time we come together,” Biden tweeted earlier Saturday.
“It’s time we see each other as fellow Americans, who don’t just live in red states and blue states, but who live in — and love — the United States of America.”"

Quarterback Cam Newton was the only Patriots player who tested positive, as of Saturday night, and the team officially placed him on the COVID-19 reserve list.
The NFL had not seen any game times or dates impacted by COVID-19 through the first three weeks.
Coincidentally, the Saints on Friday asked New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell to allow fans (approximately 25 percent of capacity) to attend the team’s game in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on Oct. 12.

He flew on Air Force One with the president multiple times over the past week, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Since Trump’s own diagnosis, multiple aides, reporters and members of Congress and more have revealed they’ve contracted the virus — including advisers Kellyanne Conway and Chris Christie and Campaign Director Bill Stepien.
Trump is currently battling the disease at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where his physician says he is doing well but “not yet out of the woods.”

Some 62 fines have been dispensed under the new crackdown in Brooklyn and Queens, according to a Sunday afternoon post on the city’s official Twitter account.
The six-figure sum represents a different approach compared to a recent, far more anemic stab at enforcement by the city.
City sources noted that five of the fines — for the maximum allowable penalty of $15,000 a piece — were issued to the organizers of Orthodox religious gatherings in Borough Park, Brooklyn that each drew hundreds of people.
Sometimes violent protests raged late last week in the community following Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision to close non-essential businesses and restrict the sizes of religious gatherings in pockets of Brooklyn and Queens experiencing coronavirus spikes.
It was not immediately clear whether the fines were handed out under a new initiative announced by Cuomo in which state authorities would be supervising city manpower in a more stringent enforcement blitz.
The city Sheriff’s Office also busted up a clandestine rave in a Queens park early Sunday, though it technically fell outside of that borough’s two enforcement zones."

Deputies slammed the brakes on the bash around 1:50 a.m. at Cunningham Park in Fresh Meadows — just outside one of two red zones established in the borough last week with a new round of pandemic restrictions.
The agency tweeted that the “illegal rave” boasted “110+ people, DJ, tables, chairs, bar, food service, hookah attendants, lighting, torches & security personnel.”
Photos accompanying the tweet showed a sea of folding chairs by string lights and torches, along with a table of hookah paraphernalia.
The Sheriff’s Office noted that four “organizers” have been charged with criminal, parks and public-health violations.

Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, on Sunday said she will participate in Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings remotely from her office because of coronavirus risks.
“Due to Judiciary Committee Republicans’ refusal to take common sense steps to protect members, aides, Capitol complex workers, and members of the media, Senator Harris plans to participate in this week’s hearings remotely from her Senate office in the Hart building,” a spokesperson for Harris said in a statement.
The announcement came after the California lawmaker slammed Senate Republicans and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsay Graham, for going forward with the hearings after three GOP senators — including two on the committee — contracted the virus.
“By moving forward with Supreme Court confirmation hearings tomorrow — less than 2 weeks after members tested positive — Chairman Graham and Senate Republicans are endangering the lives of not just members and our staff, but the hardworking people who keep the Senate complex running,” Harris tweeted.
Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), both committee members, tested positive for the virus after attending the Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony where President Trump formally introduced Barrett as his nominee.
They have both said they hoped to be recovered and be present for the hearings, which begin on Monday.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, has called on Graham (R-S.C.) to get tested for COVID-19 before the hearings begin because he has been exposed to those with the disease.
Graham told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he took a test last week and was negative.
“Anybody that has a concern about showing up can virtually interview Judge Barrett,” he added. “She will be there. I will be there… We’re going to work safely.”
It’s unclear exactly how many senators will join Harris and participate in the proceedings remotely.
Harris, Joe Biden’s running mate in the presidential election, is expected to be in the spotlight when Democrats question Trump’s High Court nominee, especially after her grilling of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings in 2018.

611,Trump tweet claiming coronavirus ‘immunity’ flagged by Twitter,https://nypost.com/2020/10/11/trump-tweet-claiming-coronavirus-immunity-flagged-by-twitter/,2020-10-11 00:00:00,"Twitter on Sunday flagged a post in which President Trump claimed that he is now “immune” to the coronavirus — the latest message from the commander-in-chief marked as violating the social-media site’s rules.
“This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19,” reads the message that users now have to click through in order to access the original post. “However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.”
The move also disables all ways of interacting with the tweet, except for retweeting it with a comment.
In the message, Trump wrote that he has received a “total and complete sign off” from White House doctors and that he is now “immune” to the virus that has thus far killed nearly 215,000 Americans.
Trump similarly declared himself “immune” during a morning appearance on Fox News but clarified that he didn’t know how long that immunity would last.
Researchers have said that it appears possible for someone to contract COVID-19 again within months of beating the bug.
Trump, who has previously had tweets flagged by the site, has accused it of tweaking its algorithm against him andd other conservative voices."

President Trump on Sunday said emergency use authorization should be coming “very soon” so that everybody can get the “miracle” antibody treatment he believes is a “cure” for coronavirus.
“I know people call it a therapeutic, but to me it’s a cure,” Trump told Fox News of Regeneron’s experimental cocktail of monoclonal antibodies he took while hospitalized from COVID-19.
“We’re going to be delivering that to hospitals — we’re waiting for the emergency use authorization,” he said, promising it would be coming “very soon.”
“We’re going to be delivering that to hospitals all over the country — and ultimately all over the world — because it’s it’s incredible,” he said, calling the treatment made by a New York-based firm a “miracle.”
“We’ll clean out the hospitals — we’ll get everybody out of the hospitals,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”
Trump again said he “felt really good almost after taking it” — while stressing that he “would have done well anyway” battling the contagion because he is so healthy.
“But, you know, who wants to take a chance, as the expression goes,” he said."

President Trump said he is now “immune” to the coronavirus after beating the disease — and is ready to hit the campaign trail again with the all clear from his physician.
“It seems like I’m immune, so I can go way out of a basement, which I would have done anyway,” Trump said on “Sunday Morning Futures” when asked by Maria Bartiromo about the White House doctor’s not that he was no longer contagious.
“The president is in very good shape to fight the battles,” Trump added. “I beat this crazy horrible China virus… I passed the highest test, the highest standards, and I’m in great shape. And I have to tell you I feel fantastically. I really feel good.”
The president said he doesn’t know how long he is immune — “maybe a long time, maybe a short time. It could be a lifetime. Nobody really knows, but I’m immune.”
“I even feel good by the fact that, you know, the word ‘immunity’ means something,” he added. “Having really a protective glow means something. I think it’s very important to have that. To have that is a very important thing.”
Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive on Thursday, Oct. 1, two days after the presidential debate with former Vice President Joe Biden.
On that Friday he traveled to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for three days of treatment before returning to the White House.
His doctor, Sean Conley, wrote in a memo released by the White House on Saturday that the president is no longer contagious.
“This evening I am happy to report that in addition to the President meeting the CDC criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning’s COVID PCR sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” the memo said."

The World Health Organization has warned leaders against relying on COVID-19 lockdowns to tackle outbreaks — after previously saying countries should be careful how quickly they reopen.
WHO envoy Dr. David Nabarro said such restrictive measures should only be treated as a last resort, the British magazine the Spectator reported in a video interview.
“We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus,” Nabarro said.
“The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted, but by and large, we’d rather not do it.”
Nabarro said tight restrictions cause significant harm, particularly on the global economy.
“Lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never, ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer,” he said.
He added that lockdowns have severely impacted countries that rely on tourism.
“Just look at what’s happened to the tourism industry in the Caribbean, for example, or in the Pacific because people aren’t taking their holidays,” Nabarro told the outlet.
“Look what’s happened to smallholder farmers all over the world. Look what’s happening to poverty levels. It seems that we may well have a doubling of world poverty by next year. We may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition.”
The UN agency previously warned countries against lifting lockdowns too soon during the first wave of the virus.
“The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses, only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,” said Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
But Tedros had urged countries to bolster other measures, including widespread testing and contact tracing, so they could safely reopen and avoid future lockdowns.
“We need to reach a sustainable situation where we have adequate control of this virus without shutting down our lives entirely, or lurching from lockdown to lockdown — which has a hugely detrimental impact on societies,” he said.

The NFL Week 5 schedule won’t happen as planned amid more COVID-19 chaos.
The Patriots vs. Broncos game has been postponed to next Sunday, after the Patriots had a new COVID-19 positive Sunday morning. The game had already been pushed to Monday at 5 p.m. after cornerback Stephon Gilmore tested positive midweek. The Broncos were supposed to play the Dolphins next Sunday, but that game has been rescheduled to Week 11.
The Titans also had a new positive case Sunday. Facilities for both teams were shut down Sunday morning. The Titans’ game vs. the Bills was previously pushed to Tuesday at 7 p.m. There were no other positives around the NFL Sunday morning, according to multiple reports.
A slew of NFL games have been rescheduled to make everything work. This Thursday’s scheduled Bills-Chiefs game has been moved to next Monday at 5 p.m.; the Jets’ Week 10 game against the Dolphins has been moved to Week 6, and the Jets’ Week 6 game against the Chargers has been shifted to Week 11; The Jaguars-Chargers game moves from Week 8 to Week 7; the Chargers-Broncos game from Week 11 moves to Week 8 and Chargers-Dolphins moves from Week 7 to Week 10.
Defensive tackle Byron Cowart is the latest Patriots player to test positive, according to multiple reports.
Cam Newton was the first Patriot to test positive on Oct. 3. He missed last week’s rescheduled game vs. the Chiefs and remains on the reserve/COVID-19 list. The Patriots also had practice-squad defensive tackle Bill Murray test positive. The Patriots had returned to their practice facility on Saturday after shutting down on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the Titans are still dealing with more cases after a teamwide outbreak led to the postponement of their Week 4 game against the Steelers. They’ve had 24 positive tests since Sept. 24, including 13 players.
“This morning we learned that a staff member tested positive. We have temporarily closed our facility and are in communication with the league on the next steps,” the Titans said in a statement.
The Titans had returned to their facility Saturday for the first time since Sept. 29. The NFL and NFLPA have been investigating whether the team violated the league’s COVID-19 protocols."

The president initially weighed acting frail when discharged from Walter Reed National Medical Center last Monday and then revealing the Superman shirt as a sign of strength but decided against going through with the stunt, the New York Times reported on Saturday.
Trump tested positive for the coronavirus on Oct. 1 – two days after the presidential debate with Joe Biden – and was taken to Walter Reed the following day for treatment after his oxygen levels fell.
He returned to the White House on Oct. 5 and released a video message he taped on the balcony telling Americans not to be fearful of the coronavirus.
“I learned so much about coronavirus and one thing that’s for certain, don’t let it dominate you,” the president said in the video.
“Don’t be afraid of it. You’re gonna beat it. We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines — all developed recently,” he said.
In an interview last Thursday on Fox Business Network, Trump said he was able to beat the coronavirus because he’s in such great shape.
“I’m back because I am a perfect physical specimen and I’m extremely young. And so I’m lucky in that way,” Trump told Maria Bartiromo on the show.
White House Dr. Sean Conley said Saturday that the president is no longer contagious, clearing the way for Trump to return to the campaign trail.
“This evening I am happy to report that in addition to the President meeting the CDC criteria for the safe discontinuation of isolation, this morning’s COVID PCR sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,” Conley wrote in a memo released by the White House."
617,"Cuomo’s, de Blasio’s school shutdowns are breaking parents like me",https://nypost.com/2020/10/11/cuomos-and-de-blasios-school-shutdowns-are-breaking-parents-like-me/,2020-10-11 00:00:00,"As COVID-19 situations go, mine is relatively blessed. My job has always been work-from-home. My husband has been working from home since March and is a huge help. My kids are mostly well-behaved and competent. Two of my kids go to ­in-person schooling two to three days a week, one of the better blended models. My other child’s school has a well-developed virtual-learning program.
Yet I’m drowning.
We have alarms set all over the house, but we miss at least one virtual class a week. There is always a missing Zoom password or a Google Classroom that isn’t working. And the remote days are mostly busywork anyway.
We try to give the kids outdoor time, and time with their friends, so there’s a lot of “You take him to soccer!” met with “No, I’ve got a call — you take him to soccer!” We are always late for soccer.
Our sons go to the same school, but one starts 20 minutes later than the other and finishes 15 minutes earlier. It isn’t enough time to get home and back again, so every in-person day, one of us ends up spending 35 minutes standing outside the school building with a 4-year-old, forcing him to keep his mask on and not get too close to others.
It’s like putting socks on a rooster.
My husband and I somehow still like each other after spending ­every day of the last seven months together, but we aren’t immune from yelling, “I have to work!” at each other when the stress gets to be too much.
“Go easy on yourself,” people tell me. But I can’t. Being a parent means protecting and caring for your children. I see them floundering, and it doesn’t make it better that it’s happening to all the kids around us, too.
We considered distant private schools for our youngest. But we decided against it, after all. For one thing, three kids at three different schools might kill me. For another, at age 4, social interaction matters the most. We want him to have friends in his neighborhood, to walk the few blocks to his school together with his brother.
Beyond that, we have no faith that Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo won’t close private schools as cruelly, arbitrarily and irrationally as they close public ones.
And that’s exactly what happened last week, when Hizzoner asked the state to close schools, both public and private, in ZIP codes with slightly elevated COVID-19 positive rates, starting Wednesday. Cuomo, who takes a sadist’s pleasure in putting the mayor in his place, responded by ordering schools closed Tuesday.
Cuomo also introduced a very complicated color-coding system for neighborhood closures that mostly aligned with the mayor’s ZIP codes. Schools in the red and orange zones would be closed for 14 days, while the yellows could remain open if they hadn’t been closed earlier. Or something. It’s all insanely convoluted.
Parents are aghast. The schools hadn’t had cases, yet our leaders were punishing the kids because the neighborhood has an elevated positive rate. Never mind that positive cases don’t necessarily translate to hospitalizations, deaths or overwhelmed health systems — what lockdowns are supposed to tame.
I know I’m not the only parent thinking about pausing my career indefinitely because our schools are such a disaster. What will it mean for the productivity of an already-hurting city if a large number of people need to stop working to educate their kids?
Countries around the world led with school reopenings, and the rest of their economies followed. Even when they ponder new lockdowns, other countries exclude schools. The virus, after all, poses a minuscule risk to children, who also transmit it at a much lower rate than do adults.
In September, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that “schools should be the very last bit of society that we want to close down again.”
Not us. Our hapless leaders close schools first and figure out why later. Kids are adrift. Parents are faced with unthinkable choices. It’s breaking us.

Statistics involving 200,000 schoolkids from 47 states in the last two weeks of September yielded an overall coronavirus infection rate of just .13 percent among students and .24 percent for staffers, according to Brown University economics Professor Emily Oster and her team of number-crunchers.
The figures translate into what would be roughly 1.3 infections for a school with 1,000 kids in the two-week period, and 2.2 positive tests for every 1,000 staffers in the same time frame.
“I think it was thought the minute we get people together in schools, there would be these huge outbreaks — and that hasn’t come to pass,’’ Oster told The Post on Sunday.
She added that it is crucial to weigh the dangers of the virus against the drawbacks to online learning for students, teachers and parents.
“It’s tricky to say, ‘Why not be safe and do the safest thing’ ” and go to all-remote learning, Oster said. “Well, you’re not looking at the e-mails I’m getting.”
She recounted how a woman wrote her Sunday morning “and said her daughter’s best friend killed herself and left a note saying, ‘I can’t handle the way school is.’ ”
The dead student was in high school.
“That is just an anecdote, but I think we are forgetting the human cost on the other side some of the time,’’ Oster said.
The prof specifically called out New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for allegedly treating schools as if they were major coronavirus breeding grounds without the figures to back it up.
“Democratic governors who love to flaunt their pro-science bona fides in comparison with the anti-science Trump administration don’t seem to be aware of this growing body of evidence,’’ Oster wrote in The Atlantic magazine Friday.
“On Monday, for instance, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo claimed that businesses were not ‘mass spreaders,’ as opposed to schools, and subsequently announced that he would close schools in hot-spot areas.”
She added to The Post, “He said schools are a big risk. … I don’t think he has good data showing that.’’
A spokesman with the governor’s office responded to The Post on Sunday, “We know mass gatherings, congregate settings have the highest rate of transmission.
“Schools do have a congregate setting,’’ the rep said.
He said the governor has been pushing testing in schools because more data is needed and “not enough is being done in the city” so far to get adequate statistics.
“We’ve been flying blind,’’ the spokesman said. “And that’s what’s not acceptable.’’
As The Post reported Saturday, the number of COVID-19 cases in the city‘s public schools went up 67 percent in the past week and involved 98 students and 207 teachers. The percentage rate of the positive tests one week to the next was not immediately clear.
Oster — whose own kids, ages 5 and 9, are back full-time in the classroom at their private school in Rhode Island — said there definitely needs to be more data collected before any final conclusions can be drawn.
“I think our big takeaway is it’s invaluable to see the numbers and with what [people] are comfortable with,’’ she said, noting her group has been reaching out to states and national and local public and private school organizations to get more data."
619,Two Jets games rescheduled amid NFL’s COVID-19 scramble,https://nypost.com/2020/10/11/two-jets-games-rescheduled-amid-nfls-covid-19-scramble/,2020-10-11 00:00:00,"The NFL scrambled the Jets’ schedule Sunday as the league moves games around due to COVID-19 postponements for other teams.
The Jets will now play at Miami next week at 4:05 p.m. That game had been scheduled for Week 10 on Nov. 15. The Jets will now have a bye that week. The game at the Chargers, which had been scheduled for Sunday, will move to Nov. 22 (Week 11) at 4:05 p.m.
The Jets found out about the changes after their game Sunday.
“We’ve got to play somebody, so it doesn’t affect me,” linebacker Avery Williamson said. “It shouldn’t affect anybody.”
RB Le’Veon Bell returned after missing three games with a hamstring injury — but he was not very effective, as usual during his time with the Jets. He had 13 carries for 60 yards and one catch for 7 yards. He was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 run and stopped on a third-and-1 pitch to the outside, on which he looked very slow.
Bell, who has not done any interviews since Sept. 10, refused to do a Zoom interview with reporters after the game.
Jets head coach Adam Gase was asked if he could provide a reason to hope this 0-5 start can be turned around. He pointed to how the team is practicing.
“If you were there day in and day out and saw those guys how they practiced last week, you wouldn’t know what our record was,” Gase said.
The Jets were unable to practice Friday after a player had a positive COVID-19 test. The test turned out to be a false positive, but the Jets sent all players and coaches home. They ended up doing some makeup work on Saturday.
“Not practicing Friday kind of took the wind out of our sails a little bit,” Gase said, “but I thought they did a good job Saturday when they came in, and we kind of extended the day and tried to make up for all that stuff through walk-throughs and going through the practice the day before.”
Gase did not have an update on starting QB Sam Darnold, who is dealing with a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder. He said he should know more Monday about Darnold’s availability for next week. … WR Chris Hogan left the game with an ankle injury. Gase, who said the injury “didn’t look good,” added that Hogan will undergo an MRI exam on Monday.
Rookie CB Lamar Jackson made his first start in place of an injured Bless Austin. … George Fant moved to LT from RT with Mekhi Becton sidelined. Chuma Edoga started at RT. It was the fourth different offensive line combination the Jets have used in five games."

“Passover time, we were all on lockdown — most of us got sick, we lost some of the best in the community,” a woman who gave her name as Chaya said at the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters on Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, where some 200 worshipers gathered.
Now, “we’re on the other side” of the pandemic, she insisted.
She brushed off as “fake news” the infection spikes recently recorded across a broad swath of central Brooklyn, which Thursday led to strict rules limiting gatherings to under 25 people, or under 10 in the worst so-called “hot spots.”
“The numbers are nothing like they were, also it’s more treatable,” Chaya told a Post reporter. “The community doctors are telling us to live our lives.”
Agreed another worshiper there, “People don’t understand that we have herd immunity.”
He said, “People don’t understand that we have not had people going to the hospitals for months and months and months.
“We have doctors in our community who are telling us what to do,” he added.
“When you see for so long people are not getting sick anymore, we feel that we can celebrate.”
Mostly mask-less crowds gathered along 13th and 14th avenues in Hasidic Borough Park, though there were none of the violent protests against coronavirus restrictions that broke out earlier in the week.
In Williamsburg, Hooper Street in front of Congregation Yetev Lev D’Satmar was closed off to make room for the observance.
“Nobody wears a mask inside,” a man who cleans the synagogue told The Post, asking his name not be used.
“Nobody cares. Often there are hundreds — no masks,” he complained.
“The cops give them masks outside [the synagogue] and inside they…”
Here, the worker made a gesture of flinging a mask away from his face.
“But what am I gonna do? I have to work,” he added. “It’s kind of hard to find a job right now.”
Not all of the Orthodox rules behave recklessly, said Alex Adama, who lives two blocks from the Satmar neighborhood in South Williamsburg.
But “there is a large group who don’t,” he said.
“I think they are using religion to justify criminal behavior,” he said.
“They don’t believe in science, and if anyone says anything about it, they say you are anti-Semites.
“I don’t understand why the city can’t do anything. Cuomo and de Blasio said they will start enforcing these rules, but I haven’t seen it.”"

The reality: Cuomo denied the threat’s seriousness longer than President Trump. And when he woke up, he panicked — with deadly consequences for New York’s seniors. Now he’s locked into lockdown extremism, admitting that his “leadership” is based not on science, but fear.
For weeks after announcing the state’s first COVID-19 case March 1, Cuomo on a daily basis told New Yorkers not to worry. On March 4, for example: “We have an epidemic caused by coronavirus but we have a pandemic that is caused by fear.” March 9: “This hysteria that you see, this fear that you see, the panic that you see is unwarranted. We have dealt with worse viruses.”
March 5: Think of the criticism lobbed at the Trump administration about ""downplaying"" the virus. Cuomo does this over and over and over… “Here, the facts do not merit the level of anxiety that we are seeing.” https://t.co/eQlLTdZPd3 6/
— Stu Burguiere (@StuDoesAmerica) October 15, 2020

As late as March 19, Cuomo claimed: “We are fighting the virus and we are fighting fear. . . . In many ways, the fear is more dangerous than the virus.” The next day, he shut New York down.
As The Blaze host Stu Burguiere notes in a long “tweetstorm,” that was four days after Trump launched his 15 Days to Slow the Spread: “Cuomo regularly criticizes the President for acting too slow. He was slower.”
And then Team Cuomo panicked. On March 25, it issued the now-infamous edict forcing nursing homes to take in COVID-positive patients — and not to even test admissions or readmissions for the virus.
Thousands of seniors died as a result. But Cuomo insists his critics are making it all up. “On April 25, conservative columnist Michael Goodwin published a piece in Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post aimed at New York with the headline, ‘State lacked common sense in nursing homes’ coronavirus approach,’ ” he writes. “It was an orchestrated strategy and a Fox News drumbeat.”
The state admits it sent 6,300-plus recovering COVID patients to nursing homes. Nearly 60 homes had not a single case before those infected patients arrived.
The Society for Post-Acute & Long-Term Care Medicine warned as early as March 29 that his order would be fatal. But Cuomo didn’t revoke it until May.
His approach now? “This is not a highly nuanced, sophisticated response. This is a fear-driven response. You know, this is not a policy being written by a scalpel. This is a policy being cut by a hatchet,” he told Jewish leaders in a call this month.
This is the man whose new book boasts of his “leadership.”"
622,Teachers at Hunter College Campus Schools warn they may still strike over COVID-19,https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/teachers-at-hunter-college-schools-warn-they-may-strike-over-covid-19/,2020-10-18 00:00:00,"The teachers union for Hunter College Campus Schools said Sunday it may still strike over COVID-19 concerns.
“The Hunter Campus administration has said the school will open [Monday]. And I, the teachers are talking with each other, meeting and will continue to figure out what’s best to do individually and collectively,’’ said Professional Staff Congress President Barbara Bowen on a conference call with reporters, teachers and parents.
“At this point, we are not threatening a strike tomorrow,’’ she said. “However, if these things are not addressed, we will have to go back to that strike-authorization vote’’ from September.
Hunter College Campus consists of an elementary and a high school, both of which are on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, publicly funded, overseen by the City University of New York and run by Hunter College for its teachers-in-training, according to its Web site.
“The faculty at Hunter Campus schools, the teachers, knew all along this summer that the provisions that Hunter was making to keep children separate to prevent infection were not sufficient,” Bowen said.
“Over and over again, we met with them and called for the correct measures, and over and over again, they turned us down,’’ she said.
The union chief noted that there were four cases of the coronavirus in two kindergarten classes, including two teachers, at the elementary school within the first two and a half weeks.
She said the lack of greater testing at the school should be immediately addressed.
“All of us have concerns about having better PPE,’’ too, Bowen added. “There’s obviously better equipment that is needed here because what was in place is not working.
“The practice of allowing that accommodation for people to work remotely has not been as vigorous, as well, directed as it should be. We would like to see the Hunter Campus administration advocate much more vigorously.”
“The administration is saying we’ll open Monday. The union leadership and the faculty leadership at Hunter Campus schools thinks that’s a very, very bad and potentially dangerous mistake. And so, we hope that we don’t have to take more dramatic action.”
Campus math educator Tina Moore, said, “Our teachers are scared, they’re nervous.
“We feel that the safety protocols that the school has put in place did not work and did not keep our students safe.”
In an e-mailed statement to The Post, the school administration said, “Our reopening plan met the highest health and safety standards and was approved under the CUNY guidelines all of which were much more stringent that the NYC Department of Education’s.”
School officials said they took steps such as “ensur[ing] physical distancing through extensive signage and rearrangement of furniture; implementing a daily mandatory health screening process; adding extensive hand sanitizing stations throughout both buildings; and requiring face coverings and regular hygiene practices for the safety of our entire community.
“HEPA filters were installed in classrooms in both buildings,” too, the statement said.
“Students and their families were overwhelmingly happy and grateful to return to school. More than 60% chose to send their children back to the classroom,” Campus officials said."

“The 48 only relates to if we want to get it done before the election — which we do,” Pelosi said on ABC News’ “This Week.” “But we’re saying to them we have to freeze the design on some of these things, are we going with it or not, and what is the language.”
Pressed on the success of an agreement by anchor George Stephanopoulos, the California Democrat said it “depends on the administration.”
“We don’t have agreement in the language yet, but I’m hopeful,” Pelosi said. “I’m optimistic because, again, we’ve been back and forth on all of this.”
She and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been in talks for months in an effort to hammer out a stimulus deal.
They spoke for more than an hour on Saturday and are expected to return to the negotiating table on Monday.
Stephanopoulos also noted that the speaker and President Trump haven’t spoken in a year, and asked Pelosi if she was willing to pick up a phone to talk to the White House.
“I have a great deal of respect for the office I hold, speaker of the House, and I have a great deal of respect for the position that he holds, president of the United States. This is not a casual conversation. This is about a meeting of the head of the first branch of government, the legislative branch, and the president,” she said.
In May, the Democratic-controlled House approved a $3 trillion package that went nowhere in the Senate.
The White House offered a compromise $1.8 billion plan.
Pelosi said the deal’s price tag was just a part of what it needs to offer.
“The testing. The tracing. The treatment. The mask-wearing. The separation. The sanitation. And all that goes with it,” she said, adding that she wants more information about a national strategy to combat the pandemic.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Saturday he plans to have the Senate vote on a $300 billion “skinny” stimulus package on Wednesday.
That bill was already rejected by Democrats in September"
624,Gov. Cuomo’s COVID-19 book omits any mention of Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul,https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/cuomos-covid-19-book-omits-mention-of-lt-gov-kathy-hochul/,2020-10-18 00:00:00,"Lieutenant Governor who?
A new 300-page pandemic memoir by Gov. Andrew Cuomo conspicuously omits any mention of his lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul.
Cuomo highlights the work of numerous appointees and subordinates in his administration who helped him respond to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The governor even devotes a whole passage in “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic’’ to how he still wears an old pair of shoes worn by his late father, former Gov. Mario Cuomo.
But there is no mention of Hochul, his running mate who is next in line to replace him in an emergency.
State politics-watchers say the move is further proof that Cuomo is not one to share the spotlight with anyone of potential public import, even technically his right-hand woman, a Buffalo-area ex-congresswoman who has been largely relegated to meet-and-greet public events.
“It’s not a surprise the governor didn’t mention Hochul in the book — but he should’ve,’’ a veteran Democratic insider told The Post.
Another party source said, “Nobody in CuomoLand likes anybody who is remotely trying to steal the limelight … Everybody in that book mentioned reports to Cuomo. It’s about the governor. Period.”
A third Dem source called Hochul’s omission ‘’very revealing” — and far from a mistake.
“You know Andrew Cuomo had that book vetted politically and strategically,’’ the source said.
In keeping with what has become an open secret in Albany about Hochul’s lack of power, she has been missing from her Democratic boss’s daily pandemic press conferences — except when he holds events on her turf in the Buffalo region.
Cuomo also did not assign Hochul to oversee any substantial task in his administration’s handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, appointing her only to head the COVID-19 advisory “control room” for western New York.
Former Republican New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey said the under-use of Hochul is a pity.
“The lieutenant governor can help the governor get things done,” said McCaughey, who served with Gov. George Pataki.
McCaughey headed Pataki’s task force on Medicaid reform and produced a report on the benefits of early childhood education, among other things.

“It’s a disservice and a shame that Lt. Gov Hochul’s energy and talents are being wasted and not used to benefit the public,” McCaughey said.
“I’d like to appoint her to a petty tyrant commission. There should be term limits on tyrants,” she quipped, jokingly referring to Cuomo.
McCaughey fell out of favor with Pataki after stealing some of his thunder — including standing up behind him during his entire State of the State address one year — and clashing with him and his team during his first four-year term starting in 1995.
Senior Cuomo adviser Rich Azzopardi told The Post in a statement that it “is silly” to make anything out of the fact that Hocul was left out of the governor’s book.
“The lieutenant governor has been our eyes and ears in western New York throughout this public-health crisis and has been an invaluable partner in helping to communicate both the severity of this pandemic and how to combat it,” he wrote in an e-mail.
“The book is an inside account that chiefly centered on the team located in Albany. Not even apples and oranges: apples and bicycles,” the top aide said, referring to any attempt to compare the Albany group’s work with Hochul’s in her region.
As for Hochul, her camp downplayed her absence in Gov. Cuomo’s book.
“Lt. Governor Hochul is proud of the efforts she and the Governor accomplish together every single day for all New Yorkers,’’ Hochul’s chief of staff, Jeff Lewis, said in a statement to The Post.
“Despite any suggestion otherwise, she will continue to be a partner to the Governor throughout the state’s ongoing and unprecedented pandemic response and recovery. Let’s stay focused and smart. Wear a mask.
“As the Governor announced in April, Lt. Governor Hochul leads WNY’s Control Room, comprised of County officials and public health leaders, and there is no dispute she has been key in delivering the Administration’s message in her over 450+ interviews and media appearances across the state. That would be impossible without our teams being completely in-sync. We don’t take the responsibility of public service lightly,” Lewis added.
Aides mentioned in Cuomo’s book include secretary and top aide Melissa DeRosa. She gets a nod on the first page.
Then there is Budget Director Robert Mujica; now-SUNY Chancellor and former aide Jim Malatras; communications director Peter Ajemian; Azzopardi; press secretary Caitlin Girouard, who was outed as infected with COVID-19, and financial services official Gareth Rhodes.
New York’s governors and lieutenant governors run on one line as a ticket in the general election, although candidates for the lower job must win a separate party primary if there is a challenge.
In 2008, David Paterson became the first lieutenant governor in the state since 1973 to become governor because of his boss’s resignation. At the time, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a k a “Client No. 9,’’ had resigned over a prostitution scandal.
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller resigned in 1973 to focus on a presidential bid, paving the way for Lt. Gov. Malcolm Wilson to take the reins."
625,Gov. Cuomo says banned massive Hasidic wedding isn’t ‘top of list of concerns’,https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/gov-cuomo-banned-hasidic-wedding-isnt-top-of-list-of-concerns/,2020-10-18 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday dismissed angst over the banned massive Hasidic wedding in Brooklyn as “not on the top of list of concerns’’ for the state amid COVID-19.
“I understand their point. They had planned a large wedding. And everybody was excited for the wedding. And then the government says you can’t have this large wedding. How terrible. We were all excited about this large wedding,’’ said the governor — fewer than two days after the state barred the planned celebration because it was expected to draw 10,000 people together amid the pandemic.
“You can’t have a wedding now with thousands of people,’’ the governor said. “There is no safe way to do that. We know that. We know that a party with a hundred people has generated issues.’’
He noted that one of his daughters didn’t have a college-graduation ceremony this year because of the virus and that people have died in nursing homes and hospitals from COVID-19, including without being able to have their loved ones near them for comfort.
“On the scale, I think, ‘I really wanted a big wedding’ isn’t on the top of the list of concerns,’’ Cuomo said.
“My suggestion: Have a small wedding this year. Next year, have a big wedding. Invite me, I’ll come.’’
Williamsburg has been one of the worst recent resurging COVID-19 hot spots in the city, with an infection rate of more than three times that of the overall Big Apple as many people have openly flaunted mandated health restrictions there.
The Jewish wedding, set for Monday, is for the grandchild of Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, a grand rabbi of the Satmar sect. It was expected to draw massive crowds outside venues on Rodney Street and Bedford Avenue, where there is a Satmar synagogue and the sect’s United Talmudical Academy.
Infuriated organizers said after the state’s order barring the crowd that they would not allow outdoor guests at the event and that it would only be attended by close family members."
626,Gov. Cuomo says changes to NY COVID-19 restrictions may come this week,https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/gov-cuomo-changes-to-ny-covid-19-restrictions-may-come-this-week/,2020-10-18 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
Changes to the restrictions on New York’s coronavirus clusters could be announced later this week as the surge in cases continues to recede, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday.
“We’re going to watch the micro-cluster data,” Cuomo told reporters in his Midtown Manhattan office. “We can adjust what is in that cluster. We can make it a little bigger. We can make it a little smaller. We can relax some regulations. We can increase regulations. We’ll do that all based on the data.”
Cuomo said that any such alterations would be announced Wednesday, just over two weeks after he announced a color-coded system of restrictions — including closures of schools and non-essential businesses — to tamp down burgeoning outbreaks in Brooklyn and Queens, as well as pockets upstate.
The latest data from those zones shows that that effort appears to be working.
In the week of Sept. 27 through Oct. 3, the coronavirus positive rate in Brooklyn’s so-called “red zone” was 6.69 percent.
By Saturday, that figure had dropped to 4.92 percent.
Queens — which has two distinct outbreak zones — also saw a decline, from a 2.97 percent positivity rate during the earlier period to 1.89 percent on Saturday.
The Brooklyn and Queens zones, however, still have markedly higher positivity rates than the overall state figure of 1.08 percent.
“Because we’re so aggressive, every time we see the virus pop up, we run and hit it down,” said Cuomo. “It’s like Whack-A-Mole.”
The decision earlier this month to reinstate coronavirus restrictions was met with fierce and sometimes violent protests, particularly in Brooklyn’s Hasidic enclaves, where some viewed the lockdowns as anti-Semitic.
But Cuomo insisted on Sunday that the return of restrictions was the way to go.
“This is not rocket science,” he said. “It’s a virus. When you reduce congregate activity, and people wear masks, and people social-distance and you enforce it, you stop the spread of the virus. That’s how it works. That’s how it’s always worked. You just have to do it.”
Meanwhile, the governor unveiled a plan to transition from the pandemic to the powder with winter on the way.
Starting Nov. 6, the state’s ski resorts will be allowed to reopen at 50 percent capacity, he said.
Other precautions will also be in place, including a requirement to wear masks at all times except when eating, drinking or skiing; restrictions on gondola and lift usage to one party at a time; thorough cleanings and disinfections of all shared or rented equipment; and a potential reduction of capacity on the slopes to 25 percent on peak days or if there are trail closures.
Cuomo tried to entice out-of-state skiers to pump money into New York’s sagging economy by saying other perks make up for the restrictions.
“If you ski New York this year, not only do you have what I think is the best skiing in the United States of America … but there’s an added benefit,” he said. “If you ski in New York, not only do you have the best skiing in the United States, but you don’t have to quarantine when you come back.
“Go ski in one of these other states, then you have to quarantine for 14 days.”"

That’s because Andrew Siciliano has never missed an edition of DirecTV’s NFL Red Zone since it began in 2005. Until now.
Siciliano announced on Twitter he would not be hosting Sunday’s whiparound show because he tested positive for COVID-19. Siciliano said he feels “great” and tested negative in a follow-up test to his Sunday morning positive.
“After testing negative twice during the week, I tested positive this morning. We re-tested and it came back negative, but out of the super abundance of caution and to be respectful to my great teammates, I’m sitting this one out,” Siciliano, also a host on NFL Network, said in a video. “First time I have watched Sunday football on the couch in the afternoon since 2004, the year before we launched the Red Zone channel.”

628,Gov. Cuomo lays out massive COVID-19 vaccination plan across New York,https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/cuomo-lays-out-massive-covid-19-vaccination-plan-across-ny/,2020-10-18 00:00:00,"New York is planning to set up “mass vaccination sites’’ once COVID-19 vaccines become available through the federal government and vetted by an independent state panel, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.
The governor — in rolling out a statewide vaccine-distribution strategy — said the effort would be the largest that New York has undertaken since the coronavirus pandemic began in March.
“How do you administer 40 million vaccines to the state of New York? That is the trick,’’ Cuomo said at a press briefing.
He said so many doses are needed because there are 20 million state residents, and “most of the vaccines they’re talking about require two doses’’ three to four weeks apart.
The governor said hospitals, urgent-care centers, primary-care locations, pharmacies and state Health Department offices are among the sites being considered for vaccine distribution.
He said the first round of doses would go to both those people most at risk for COVID-19 and front-line healthcare workers in hot spots.
The next round would be extended to those two groups statewide, and after that, everyone in areas with the highest rates of infection, followed by the rest of the population.
Still, he noted what he described as significant obstacles: getting the vaccines from the federal government, having them approved by his independent medical advisory panel, ensuring people trust the vaccines enough to get them, much less both doses — and even finding the proper sites to keep the medicine.
“Storage of the vaccines will have to be minus 80 degrees,’’ Cuomo said. “There is a question of how many refrigeration units would be available to do that.’’"

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Sunday that antibody treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus could be just “weeks away.”
“Hang in there with us. We are so close,” Azar told NBC’s “Meet the Press” as he warned of “mitigation fatigue” from “tired” Americans giving up on safety measures.
“We are weeks away from monoclonal antibodies for you, for safe and effective vaccines,” he said, urging viewers to help “bridge the gap” by maintaining mask-wearing and social distancing until then.
“The American people have given so much,” he told host Chuck Todd. “They’ve been locked down. They’ve been isolated and they’re tired. But the point is we’re so close.”
Azar said the US was on track to get “safe therapeutics and safe vaccines in historic record time.”
He noted how Manhattan-based drug company Pfizer announced Friday that it hopes to seek emergency use for its potential vaccine next month.
“This is incredible, historic news … that we ought to be celebrating and have a great sense of optimism for,” he said.
Being so close should also be a “recommitment” to safety measures to help “reduce cases, reduce hospitalizations [and] reduce fatalities” until then, he said.
“We need to bridge to that day, so please just give us a bit more time of your individual, responsible behavior of washing your hands, watch your distance [and] wear your face coverings when you can’t watch your distance,” he said.
“Just keep your guard up. Hang in there with us, because the days are bright ahead,” he insisted."

Fontrell Antonio Baines, 31, who goes by the stage name “Nuke Bizzle,” was arrested Friday for applying for more than $1.2 million in COVID-19 jobless relief funds in a scheme using stolen identities, according to the US Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.
Prosecutors allege Baines and his co-conspirators fraudulently obtained at least 92 pre-loaded debit cards under the names of other people, including identity theft victims, prosecutors said.
They were sent to addresses that Baines had access to in Koreatown and Beverly Hills, prosecutors said.
In posts on Instagram, the rapper boasted repeatedly about his ability to defraud California’s Employment Development Department.
Baines also shared a music video on YouTube titled “EDD” in which he raps about getting “rich off of EDD.”
In the video, he points to a stack of EDD envelopes and brags about getting rich by “go[ing] to the bank with a stack of these” — presumably a reference to the debit cards that were issued in the scheme, prosecutors said.
“Unemployment so sweet. We had 1.5 land this week,” Baines said in the video, while another rapper chimes in, “You gotta sell cocaine, I can just file a claim.”
Baines faces three felony counts of access device fraud, aggravated identity theft and interstate transportation of stolen property in connection to the scheme.
If convicted of the charges, he faces up to 22 years in federal prison."

Pfizer has already made “several hundred thousand doses” of a potential coronavirus vaccine as it prepares to seek emergency use in the US by November.
The drugmaker told the Mail on Sunday that scientists in its main British lab have also unearthed drugs that could provide a potential complete cure for COVID-19, as opposed to merely a preventative vaccine.
The firm’s UK boss, Ben Osborn, said the company is manufacturing the huge stockpile of its current vaccine candidate in Belgium “at risk and at scale,” calling it “tremendously exciting.”
“The hope here is that we essentially come up with a medicine that disrupts the virus and ultimately prevents it worsening the condition of a patient,” he told the Mail’s financial site, This Is Money.
“It was great to see the first vial coming off the manufacturing line. It just brought a tremendous smile to my face to see all of this work actually result in a product,” he said.
But “we can only go as fast as the science allows us to,” he stressed.
Pfizer expects to know whether the vaccine works by the end of this month, but the company still has to prove the shot is safe and can be manufactured properly to seek a so-called emergency use authorization, CEO Albert Bourla said Friday.
If it’s safe, he expects his company to seek emergency use in the US in the third week of November.
“We are operating at the speed of science,” he said."
632,Alabama rips Georgia after Nick Saban is cleared to coach,https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/alabama-rips-georgia-after-nick-saban-is-cleared-to-coach/,2020-10-18 00:00:00,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — A positive COVID-19 test couldn’t keep Nick Saban from the sideline, and Georgia’s heralded defense had scant hope of keeping Alabama’s playmakers out of the end zone.
Jones passed for 417 yards and four touchdowns and the Crimson Tide picked apart No. 3 Georgia’s heralded defense in the second half of a 41-24 victory Saturday night. It ended up being a decisive ‘Bama victory in a collision of the Southeastern Conference’s last remaining unbeaten teams.
The Crimson Tide (4-0), with Saban stalking the sideline after all, rallied with three touchdowns in a 10-minute span starting late in the third quarter. 
The nation’s top scoring offense ultimately got the emphatic upper hand in a battle with the Bulldogs (3-1) and one of the nation’s best defenses. 
“This was an obvious great win against a very, very good football team,” said Saban, who was cleared early in the day after a false COVID positive. “I was very proud of the way our guys fought in the game. 
“I sort of knew it was going to be a 15-round fight and we wouldn’t be winning until the late rounds.”
Georgia had no answer for Jones and star receivers Jaylen Waddle and DeVonta Smith, especially with Alabama’s own beleaguered defense grabbing two second-half interceptions and three overall. Freshman Malachi Moore had one at the goal line and returned it 42 yards.
Smith caught 11 passes for 167 yards and two touchdowns, including one in the fourth quarter that effectively put it out of reach.
Waddle caught a 90-yard touchdown pass and gained 161 yards on six catches. Jones completed 24 of 32 passes and was strong after an interception on the opening play.
“The goal was just to win the game,” Jones said. “You can look at their defense. They have good players in the secondary, they have good linebackers, they have good defensive linemen but so do we.”
Then there was some old-school ground and pound too. Najee Harris gained 152 yards on 31 carries carries with a touchdown during that game-clinching span. He did it against the nation’s top run defense, which came in allowing 38 rushing yards and 12.3 points per game.
Stetson Bennett completed 18 of 40 passes for 269 yards and two touchdowns, including an 82-yarder to James Cook. But he threw three interceptions.
Bennett was angry with himself over his mistakes, especially that final interception throwing across his body, calling it “just stupid.”
“I was frustrated with myself,” the former walk-on said. 
Alabama got a boost about seven hours before the game when the SEC cleared coach Saban to return to business of usual, determining a Wednesday COVID test was a false positive. He tested negative Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
“That was very emotional,” he said. 
“It was very crazy,” Jones said. “We were in our little quarterback meeting and he just showed up.”
A maskless Saban was yelling at a referee after an intentional grounding call in the second quarter.
The Tide has won the last six meetings with Georgia, including a 3-0 record against Saban’s former defensive coordinator, Kirby Smart. The first two came in the January 2018 national championship game and the SEC championship game the following season.
This was the first one that didn’t go down to the wire. Georgia’s defense allowed 564 yards.
“Just frustrated we couldn’t get anything going in the second half, especially that opening drive,” Smart said. “I thought we were going to be able to run the ball and we stalled out and lost momentum after that point, especially after they hit the big long bomb to Waddle.”"

Trump made the economic prediction at his Sunday rally in Carson City, Nevada, adding that the country would endure another Great Depression if Joe Biden is elected president.
“He’s gonna lock down. This guy wants to lock down,” Trump said of Biden, referring to the coronavirus lockdowns for public safety.
“He’ll listen to the scientists. If I listened totally to the scientists, we would right now have a country that would be in a massive depression.”
The president said that instead, under his watch the US economy is recovering from the pandemic.
“We’re like a rocketship. Take a look at the numbers,” Trump told the crowd.
The US, at nearly 220,000 deaths, has lost more people to the coronavirus than any other country in the world.
“This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery, which we’re in right now, or a Biden depression,” the president told the crowd.
“Depression — just remember the word,” he said.
Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesperson countered Trump’s claims, saying the president is to blame for “tanking” the economy.
“Donald Trump tanked the strong economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden Administration by continually discounting and attacking warnings from the scientific and medical experts working around the clock to save lives,” Bates told Axios in a statement."
634,Furloughed B&H workers accuse company of discrimination,https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/bh-accused-of-discrimination-by-furloughed-workers/,2020-10-18 00:00:00,"Some furloughed employees at B&H Photo Video fear that they recently lost their jobs for good — and claim it’s because they reported unsafe working conditions during the coronavirus outbreak.
After complaining about the company’s handling of the pandemic back in March — including packed indoor prayer services for its ultra-religious Jewish workers — some workers have spotted what look like postings for their jobs online. It’s a position they wouldn’t be in, they suspect, if they were part of the company’s inner circle of Hasidic Jewish staffers, who they say get special treatment.
“They definitely used COVID as a cover to eliminate some of us,” said Dan Wagner, a nearly six-year veteran of the famed New York tech retailer, which is known for its conveyor-belt system of moving merchandise around its three-story megastore on West 34th Street and Ninth Avenue.
Wagner, a professional photographer who worked as a product description writer for B&H, says he believes he has not been asked back to work after he raised a fuss in March about the daily prayer services, which took place in the company’s lunch rooms.
“I told HR that people shouldn’t congregate,” Wagner said, adding that B&H later announced in a newsletter that two workers who had attended the prayers had died from the virus in late March.
Wagner also repeatedly pressed B&H for information after learning that a fellow staffer on another floor had contracted the virus, he said. “I believe they retaliated against me for simply asking whether I was in close contact with someone with COVID.”
William Cannon, also a B&H content writer, says he believes he isn’t being brought back because he asked for permission to work from home in March. “I told [HR] that I don’t feel safe at the office, leaving in the packed elevators and working so close to others,” Cannon said.
Cannon, who is diabetic, was also unnerved by the prayer services because they were held in the same rooms where he kept his insulin, which needs to be refrigerated. “There were 60 people packed in there and I’d have to step over them to get to the refrigerator,” he said. “It was uncomfortable for me.”
B&H told Cannon to use his paid time off until it came up with a work-from-home plan, which it did about a week later. “B&H was very slow to take the pandemic seriously,” he said. “I took all my PTO days because they didn’t have a plan.”
Cannon and Wagner say they were furloughed along with about 400 other workers — about 20 percent of B&H’s staff — on April 27. The company notified workers via e-mail that they would be paid for 2.5 days and receive health benefits through May 31.
Cannon has been unable to pay for his insulin medication since June and was forced to share insulin with his diabetic uncle, with whom he lives.
Then in August, after months of no communication from the company, Cannon saw an Indeed.com posting for a mobile tech consumer writer for B&H, which was what he did for the company. The posting also called for gaming expertise, which Cannon says his manager knows he possesses.
“I took this as their way of getting rid of the people they didn’t want,” he said of the job posting. “It was so sudden with no followups. It seemed like a way to lay people off without telling them they were laid off.”
Wagner, meanwhile, saw two listings for his job as photography writer on the company’s Web site, most recently on Oct. 15.
B&H has not told the men either way what its plans are and they have not asked, but the megastore reopened to walk-ins on July 1.
After the furloughs came down, Wagner e-mailed his B&H managers to ask what percentage of laid off staffers were Hasidic, which the company declined to specify. That’s when Wagner, who is Jewish but not Hasidic, says he filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that B&H discriminates against non-Hasidic employees.
Cannon, who is African-American, said he, too, is considering filing a discrimination complaint against B&H.
Wagner declined to share a copy of his complaint with The Post, but has shared e-mails with the agency showing that he filed one.
B&H, which Blimie and Herman Schreiber opened in 1973, declined to comment on the job listings or Wagner’s discrimination complaint, except to say that it “welcomes the EEOC’s findings.”
“B&H was one of the last retailers to furlough employees,” the company’s chief marketing officer, Jeff Gerstel, told The Post in a statement.
“We’re proudly bringing back to work furloughed employees every week while we navigate these challenging times. We cannot respond to individual employee matters.”
Wagner claims B&H’s Hasidic Jewish staff get special perks, including what he believes are company-sponsored shuttle buses to help them commute to and from work.
The shuttles, which cost employees $2.75 a ride, are not offered to non-Hasidic employees, he said.
B&H declined to comment on its role in providing the buses, but a person close to the company noted that the retailer was named New York’s 14th best employer for 2020 by Forbes in August.
The popular retailer has been sued twice by the federal government for discriminatory practices, most recently in 2016 when the Department of Labor accused it of only hiring Hispanic men for entry-level positions at its former Brooklyn Navy warehouse, and then subjecting them to harassment and unsanitary conditions, including inoperable bathrooms that were separate from those used by the facility’s non-Hispanic workers. The complaint also accused the company of not hiring women, black and Asian workers at the Brooklyn facility, which has since been moved to New Jersey.
The family-owned business “categorically denied” the 2016 allegations but paid $3.22 million to settle the case and “avoid the distraction of litigation,” it said at the time.
Legal experts like Carolyn Richmond say they have been warning employers since April to take precautions not to discriminate when rehiring furloughed workers.
“The question becomes why is the employer not bringing an employee back who was let go simply because of COVID restrictions and not job performance,” said Richmond, chair of the hospitality practice group at Fox Rothschild LLP. “It is certainly suspect to replace these workers with new hires.”"

“There are some Republicans who don’t want to spend anymore. I disagree,” Graham (R-SC) said in a pre-recorded interview on “Full Court Press with Greta Van Susteren” that aired Sunday.
“I think we need more money,” he added, “but we don’t need policy provisions like the House has.”
“The $2.2 trillion coming out of the House has a mandate for ballot harvesting. What’s that got to do with COVID?” Graham said. “And the $1,200 payment, which I support, doesn’t require a Social Security number to get it, so a lot of the money would go to illegal immigrants.”
The South Carolina Republican said there’s a consensus on setting up a Paycheck Protection Program to allow small businesses to get a forgivable loan. He also noted there’s a lot of “common ground” on helping out schools.
But Graham said that while he was “willing to do some unemployment,” he disagreed with renewing the $600 weekly aid that expired July 31, arguing that “you’re paying people more not to work than work.”
Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Sunday gave the White House 48 hours to reach a deal on a new relief bill — saying otherwise, Congress will not be able to pass the relief before the November election.
Graham’s comments also came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Saturday that he will put forward a $500 billion bill to be voted on Wednesday.
The “skinny” bill, which doesn’t include a new batch of COVID-19 relief checks, would provide funds for schools and health care, liability protections, small-business spending and enhanced unemployment insurance lower than the $600 weekly, according to the Washington Post.
Other Senate Republicans have expressed opposition to the hefty spending Pelosi has sought.
But McConnell has said that should Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reach a deal, “the Senate would of course consider it.”"

Yet, The Spectator’s Toby Young sighs, the declaration has been the victim of a “well-orchestrated attempt to suppress and discredit it.” Opponents have treated it as the work of cranks, though “the three scientists who created it” are “professors at Oxford, Harvard and Stanford. And since its launch, the declaration been signed by tens of thousands of epidemiologists and public-health scientists, including a Nobel Prize winner.” Young advises: “Ignore the censors and the smear merchants. Go to gbdeclaration.org right now and sign the petition.”
Polls in Michigan, “the site of Donald Trump’s most surprising victory in 2016,” are similar to four years ago, but “one anomaly is the apparent closeness of the Senate race,” reports The Week’s Matthew Walther. GOP businessman John James is much closer to Democratic incumbent Sen. Gary Peters in polls than expected, a fact that casts doubt on Joe Biden’s lead. If Trump is to lose Michigan, “he will not do so lagging behind a political unknown in a Senate race that virtually no one expected to be competitive.” Of course, if the prez can hold other swing states like Florida and Arizona, he won’t need Michigan. Still, “if James’ recent surge in polls reflects something more closely resembling the actual state of the race, Trump’s people need not despair.”
“That America is a racist country is the great self-evident truth of the left and of the ruling class whose moral opinions are shaped by it,” writes David Azerrad at The Federalist. Yet it’s only “self-evident” in the sense that it’s held up as dogma, with “the predicate (racism)” treated as “contained in the subject (America)” — meaning “American racism cannot be refuted. It is impervious to counterarguments, data, and historical developments.” Why? “Playing the race card allows them to detract attention from their own corruption and the radical ideas they espouse. Whatever faults they have, at least they’re not racists like Donald Trump, the ­Republicans and their base of deplorables.” The political benefit is that “the right is thus constrained to fight the enemy on the enemy’s own terms.”
Just a year ago, Joe Biden declared himself decisively against court packing, but “the version of Biden who was once clear-eyed about the dangers of expanding the Supreme Court has recently become much foggier on the topic,” worries Reason’s Eric Boehm. Following President Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the high court, the ex-veep refused to clarify one way or another before suggesting that court-packing is a “bad idea” — but without refusing to rule it out. Then, during Thursday’s town hall, he granted that voters deserved to know his position before Election Day without, in fact, spelling out that position. Biden’s obfuscation is obviously a “calculated political maneuver” to avoid alienating either side, but “refusing to commit one way or the other is disrespectful to the people whose support Biden is seeking. Lots of people are already voting. This isn’t a new issue, and Biden should have been able to provide a clear and direct answer by now.”
In the Netherlands, warns Jonathan Van Maren in First Things, the government “is preparing to legalize euthanasia for children between the ages of one and twelve.” The move is popular with physicians and parents, many of whom consider it morally OK to kill children facing terminal illness. “When a doctor gives a lethal injection to a suffering infant, regardless of his motivation, he is killing that child; he and other adults have decided that child is better off dead. We used to understand how wrong that is. The Dutch government . . . appears to have forgotten.”

637,Brooklyn business owners on edge over arbitrary COVID-19 closure zones,https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/brooklyn-business-owners-on-edge-over-covid-19-closure-zones/,2020-10-18 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
They’ve been pushed to the edge.
Owners of Brooklyn businesses located near the boundaries between two of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s color-coded coronavirus restriction zones are fed-up with losing customers to competitors in more permissive zones mere feet away.
“It was getting better two weeks ago, and now we’re back to square one,” said Vito Conigliaro, manager of J&V Pizza in Bensonhurst. “We’ve just been destroyed.”
The slice spot sits about a block inside the borough’s red zone, where earlier this month Cuomo re-restricted eateries to takeout and delivery service, in one of several precautions with the coronavirus mounting a comeback.
But just a two-minute walk down 18th Avenue from J&V, hungry locals can still enjoy outdoor dining in the orange zone — and nine minutes away in the least-restrictive yellow zone, they can sit down for a meal inside a pizza purveyor.
When Mayor Bill de Blasio pushed for renewed restrictions in ZIP codes where the virus was surging, Cuomo instead opted for an approach based on COVID-19 diagnosis data rather than geography, establishing three, color-coded zones with differing levels of rules in Brooklyn, Queens and some upstate pockets.
But that method sowed some initial confusion along the borders between zones.
“We thought we were on the yellow side of the street, and they insisted we were in the orange zone, and said we have 10 minutes to vacate the facility and lock our doors,” recalled Christopher Ganim, co-owner of gym chain Harbor Fitness, of the day city Department of Buildings workers came to shutter their Mill Basin location.
“We had 75 people that we had to kick out,” he said. “They were standing in the middle of Strickland Avenue.”
The establishment is, in fact, barely inside the orange zone, where Cuomo closed what he called “high-risk,” non-essential businesses, including gyms.
While the orange zones fare better than red zones — where all non-essential businesses are closed — they lag behind the yellow zones, where Ganim’s rivals face no such restrictions.
“We have a competitor that’s a few blocks away who is allowed to stay open,” he said.
Mike Rudy, co-owner of the Funfest NY bowling alley down the block from Harbor Fitness, is allowed to stay open because bowling is considered lower-risk than gyms — albeit with a 10-person capacity for the 30,000-square-foot space, he said.
“They are basically going to put us out of business if this stays like this,” said Rudy, blasting the state restrictions as “absurd and ridiculous.”
“My front door is in an orange zone, and if I step off the sidewalk in the street, it’s yellow,” he cracked.
Rudy also questioned the methodology by which the restrictions were determined.
“I don’t know where hotspots are, but they’re definitely not over here,” he said.
Cuomo signaled on Sunday that the restrictions appear to be working and could be adjusted as early as Wednesday — just over two weeks after he announced them.
But even if that happens, Conigliaro said small businesses like his pizzeria are far from out of the woods.
“New York is in really bad shape right now,” he said. “There’s a long way to go.”"
638,All NFL Week 6 games to be played after no new COVID-19 positives,https://nypost.com/2020/10/18/all-nfl-week-6-games-to-be-played-after-no-new-covid-19-positives/,2020-10-18 00:00:00,"Staging an entire slate of games is a week-to-week proposition in a 2020 NFL season trying to plow through the coronavirus pandemic. In Week 6, the NFL appears to be in the clear.
There were no new positive COVID-19 tests Sunday morning across the NFL, according to multiple reports, meaning every NFL Week 6 game is set to be played as scheduled.
That includes the Patriots vs. Broncos game at 1 p.m. that was postponed from Week 5, and the Chiefs vs. Bills game which was pushed from Thursday to Monday after Buffalo had to play last Tuesday against the Titans. The Jets are also playing the Dolphins instead of the Chargers as part of a slew of schedule changes the NFL made last week.
The slice of positive news comes after a concerning weekend in six teams had to place at least one player on the reserve/COVID-19 list. The Patriots put three players on the list on Saturday.
The Jaguars on Saturday placed 13 players, 12 of whom are on the practice squad, on the reserve/COVID-19 list. One practice-squad player tested positive, and the other practice-squad players were placed on the list after coming in close contact with the positive player.
Game-day tests will be administered in Week 6 for the first time this NFL season."

The US just had three straight record-high days of new COVID-19 cases.
The country set an overall record Friday, with 83,757 people testing positive for the coronavirus. That figure broke the previous record of 77,640 set the day before.
And Saturday was between the two, more than Thursday’s but slightly below Friday’s record, with 83,718 Americans testing positive.
Still, the country’s more telling positivity-test rate, or its percentage of positive tests based on the overall number of those tested, has recently remained steady — and is significantly lower than what it was when the pandemic broke out in the spring.
On Saturday, the rolling seven-day average rate was 6.1 percent, according to Johns Hopkins University.
That was just up slightly from the rolling weekly average of 5.8 percent Friday — and substantially less than the daily highs of early April, which topped 22 percent.
The country’s daily death toll also has declined markedly."

There was a slight uptick in the rate of positive tests for COVID-19 in Brooklyn and Queens hot spots — as well as overall statewide — Saturday, according to the latest New York figures.
Brooklyn’s “red zone,” including Midwood — and the worst area in the city in terms of the coronavirus —  recorded a positive-test rate of 4.45 percent Saturday, compared to 4.23 percent Friday.
The latest rate in the borough’s “yellow zone’’ surrounding the red zone was 2.14 percent, as opposed to 2.07 percent the day before.
In Queens, its yellow-zone rate in Forest Hills and Kew Garden Hills was 2.93 percent compared to 2.40 percent Friday, while another yellow zone in Far Rockaway was 2.55 percent Saturday as opposed to 1.68 percent Friday, the state said.
Meanwhile, the state’s total positive-test rate was 1.35 percent Saturday, while it was 1.31 percent Friday.
Those figures were keeping in line with recent days, although slightly higher than the averages for the past two weeks, which they were 1.18 and 1.16 respectively.
Without the danger zones, the state’s overall percentage was 1.06, similar to recent daily and weekly tallies.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a conference call with reporters Sunday, called the latest figures “great news.
“We get the numbers down, then we can open up the areas. It’s just math,’’ he said, referring to the state’s recent shutdown of many businesses and in-person school learning in some of the hot zones."

Illinois’ top health official broke down as she announced the coronavirus death toll in the Prairie State.
Dr. Ngozi Ezike, Illinois’ Public Health Director, on Friday first started sniffing loudly as she announced an extra 31 deaths, taking the state-wide total to 9,418 people who had succumbed to the pandemic.
“These are people who started with us in 2020 and won’t be with us at the Thanksgiving table,” Ezike said, struggling to also announce an extra 3,874 confirmed cases for a total of 36,433.
“Excuse me, please,” she finally said — wiping tears from her eyes as she turned her back to the camera during the live-streamed briefing.
She paused for almost 40 seconds as others brought out tissues to help her compose herself, finally turning back around, saying “I’m sorry” and taking a deep breath before continuing her remarks.
She had noted the “mental, social and emotional toll” and “all the pain and all the tragedy from this pandemic.”
“I’m feeling it and living it myself,” she said, telling residents to “fight the urge to give up on social distancing.”
“The way we work, the way we live, the way we play has all changed, and the harsh reality is that the sacrifices that we’ve made, and continue to make, do not have a future expiration date,” she conceded.
“This is a difficult race when you can’t actually see the end point,” Ezike said, still pausing at times and wiping her eyes and nose."
642,Hospitals gave Gov. Andrew Cuomo a campaign booster shot: Devine,https://nypost.com/2020/10/25/hospitals-gave-gov-andrew-cuomo-a-campaign-booster-shot-devine/,2020-10-25 00:00:00,"It’s bad enough that Gov. Cuomo presided over the needless COVID-19 deaths of thousands of vulnerable people in New York nursing homes.
It’s bad enough that he wrote a shameful book praising himself for his pandemic response and now is doing a victory lap of self-congratulation in the worst-hit state in the nation.
It’s bad enough that he is mounting a pre-election scare campaign on COVID vaccines to stir up anti-vax sentiment for political purposes.
But now we discover that Cuomo got campaign funds from the hospital organizations that lobbied for his lethal policy for the elderly and which then bought TV ads whitewashing his culpability.
An exclusive audit of campaign donations to Cuomo by OpenTheBooks.com shows disturbing links with industry bodies which demanded the disastrous order forcing nursing homes to admit COVID-infected patients hospitals didn’t want.
Overall, the audit shows a “systematic pay-to-play culture in Albany,” says Adam Andrzejewski, CEO of OpenTheBooks.com, a nonprofit which has compiled a comprehensive database of US public sector expenditures.
The pattern of patronage in New York state amounts to “a legalized money-laundering scheme aimed at monetizing incumbent political power.”
Cuomo has received $6.2 million since 2014 from 347 companies who then made $7 billion from state contracts.
“Did the governor operate in his own political interest or the public interest?” asks Andrzejewski, who provided his data exclusively to The Post. “Soliciting state vendors for campaign cash is highly unethical because each instance where a state vendor gave a campaign donation and received a state contract is a potential conflict of interest.”
Most disturbing is $1 million in donations from the Greater New York Hospital Association to the governor’s re-election campaign in 2018, plus other generous in-kind support.
The association and the health-care workers union, 1199 SEIU, also spent $5.9 million lobbying in Albany in 2018.
A few days before the 2018 election, Cuomo approved a multibillion-dollar Medicaid rate hike for hospitals and nursing homes, which the association had lobbied for, and which allowed them to settle a pay dispute with the union.
Then, in February 2020, Cuomo appointed association board member and Northwell Health CEO Michael Dowling and union President Dennis Rivera to co-chair the Medicaid Redesign Team.
Dowling donated $5,000 to Cuomo six weeks before the appointment, while the union gave $15,000.
Northwell Health received $10 million in state payments in 2019, reports Andrzejewski.
When the pandemic hit in March, the association successfully lobbied the Cuomo administration to transfer COVID-positive patients to nursing homes to relieve pressure on hospitals.
Despite warnings from doctors that the move represented “a clear and present danger” to other nursing home residents, Cuomo issued his directive March 25, while federally provided beds in the Javits Center and USNS Comfort hospital ship mainly lay empty.
As we now know, the directive was a death sentence for an estimated 15,000 nursing home residents.
With the move proving to be a legal and public-relations nightmare, the association again struck gold when it lobbied for a budget provision limiting the ability of COVID-19 victims to file malpractice suits against hospitals and nursing homes.
Well satisfied with its investment in the governor, the association then spent millions on TV advertising that praised Cuomo’s management of the pandemic.
You could call the ads a quid pro Cuomo.
Cuomo’s senior adviser, Rich Azzopardi, told OpenTheBooks.com that agency contracting is done at arm’s length from the governor, “on the merits, by career civil servants and procurement professionals, with no input or influence from the Executive Chamber, and generally through a competitive bidding process.”
But the pattern of political patronage for campaign cash which Andrzejewski has uncovered in the hospital sector is repeated elsewhere across New York.
As you can see, it’s a cozy arrangement which benefits Cuomo. But it will only add to the growing unease New Yorkers have with their sky-high taxes, shoddy services and self-interested politicians.
Get ready for the mother of all scare campaigns from Democrats and their media allies the next two weeks. They’ll tell you the coronavirus is on the rampage and it’s all President Trump’s fault.
But, before we fall for the fearmongering of Joe Biden’s “dark winter,” it’s worth noting that the CDC says flu numbers are down 95 percent. Have masks stopped it, or are flu symptoms being conflated with COVID-19?
Secondly, the University of Washington model used to forecast impending doom has been getting it drastically wrong since March. Finally, the mortality rate for COVID-19 patients is plummeting as better treatments appear. One study of 5,000 patients in the NYU Langone Health system, to be published in the Journal of Hospital Medicine, finds death rates between March and August dropped 18 percentage points, even for the elderly.
Be not afraid. Be sensible.
Among the most stubborn myths around the Burisma scandal is that Ukraine’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was not investigating the corrupt energy company at the time Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid unless he was fired.
The Washington Post repeated the false claim last week.
But contemporaneous news sources from Ukraine show that Shokin was aggressively pursuing Burisma in 2016, while it was paying the then-vice president’s wayward son, Hunter Biden, more than $80,000 a month to sit on its board.
On Feb. 4, 2016, Interfax-Ukraine reported that Prosecutor-General Shokin had seized property belonging to Hunter’s boss, Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky, including four large houses, two plots of land and “a Rolls-Royce Phantom car.” The National Radio Co. of Ukraine reported the same.
Eight days later, Joe Biden phoned Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko.
Four days after the call, Shokin was fired, although it took another month for the Ukrainian parliament to ratify his ousting."
643,Operation Warp Speed is an ‘unprecedented’ success and other commentary,https://nypost.com/2020/10/25/operation-warp-speed-is-an-unprecedented-success-and-other-commentary/,2020-10-25 00:00:00,"“Attacks on President Trump’s performance on COVID-19” are “central” to Joe Biden’s campaign, notes Roger D. Klein at City Journal, and those attacks, along with the media’s “continual faultfinding,” have influenced voter opinion. But they’re “unjustified and unwarranted.” Yes, the FDA’s “initial overregulation and the Centers for Disease Control’s early underperformance” made Trump a “ready target.” But the president’s “targeted regulatory relief and financial incentives stimulated an unprecedented private-sector response to the pandemic, more than compensating.” Crucially, “Operation Warp Speed is compressing the usual new-vaccine implementation time from over ten years to a matter of months” and states that heeded Trump’s advice to reopen quickly “have seen proportionally fewer deaths from COVID-19 and have brought millions more Americans back to work than those that proceeded more slowly.”
The Spectator’s Douglas Murray joined Antifa-BLM activists in Portland for a few nights. At a “F- – k Gentrification” march, they paraded “through the streets screaming through megaphones at customers in the remaining bars and at the residents of an area which they claimed had once been lived in by black and indigenous families.” Chants of “the mostly white marchers” included “Wake up, motherf – – ker, wake up.” The next night, they set fires outside a boarded-up ICE building; police responded, only “to retreat under a barrage of ‘oink’ noises” and cries of “Nazis,” with activists “screaming through megaphones . . . about how much the officers’ children would hate their fathers.” They have now pulled down “almost every statue and public monument in the city,” and the few businesses still open operate “as in a city under siege.”
Joe Biden paradoxically wants to “help small businesses” by “raising their labor costs with a minimum wage hike” from $7.25 to $15 an hour, observes Reason’s Christian Britschgi. Most studies find a correlation between a higher minimum wage and higher unemployment rates or fewer working hours, so “it’ll likely hurt workers, too.” It’s “a bit of a mystery” how Biden could think “small businesses already coping with massive declines in revenue and increased operating costs would benefit from having their labor get more expensive.” In Thursday’s debate, Biden said struggling businesses should get more money from Congress; Britschgi snarks that “if he has his way on the minimum wage, they’ll need all the assistance they can get.”
When “you take a clear-eyed look at Biden, there is no meaningful case for his candidacy,” argues Lisa Boothe at The Hill. The Post’s reporting about Hunter Biden’s business dealings calls into question the “good guy” façade on which the Biden campaign is based. His record on racial justice “has been widely criticized by Democrats and others,” and his call for national civility is overshadowed by his behavior as a senator, leading “two of the most vitriolic, destructive Supreme Court confirmation hearings, for Judge Robert Bork and Justice Clarence Thomas.” And his constant flip-flopping means “voters have no reason to trust Biden on policies either.” While the president “certainly has his own faults, you always know where he stands and what he believes. What’s the case for Biden?”
At RealClearPolitics, Stephen Moore argues that despite Joe Biden’s claims, “there’s nothing centrist” in his economic plan. Though polls show most voters believe President Trump would be better for the economy, many also think “Uncle Joe’s economic plan is relatively harmless and won’t endanger jobs, paychecks or retirement savings.” Wrong. Moore cites several of Biden’s “economic deadly sins”: a $4 trillion tax hike, ending right-to-work laws and US energy independence and imposing a minimum wage “that will destroy millions of jobs for young people and low-skilled workers.” Many economists worry that under Biden, “we could be looking at a second Great Depression.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board"

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced the curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. will go into effect Sunday on the mainland and likely last six months in order to combat the second wave of the virus.
“The reality is that Europe and Spain are immersed in a second wave of the pandemic,” Sánchez said in a nationwide address. “The situation we are living in is extreme.”
The curfew does not apply to people who are commuting to work, buying medicine, and caring for elderly and young family members, he said.
The order also won’t be imposed in the Canary Islands, where the infection rate remains low despite jumping by more than a third in the country in the past week, the Financial Times reported.
Sanchez noted that the new decree is not as restrictive as the mandatory home confinement that he ordered in March, which lasted six weeks.
“There is no home confinement in this state of emergency, but the more we stay at home, the safer we will be. Everyone knows what they have to do,” he said.
Meanwhile, in Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte ordered that gyms, swimming pools, theaters and cinemas shut down Monday until Nov. 24 to fight rising COVID-19 cases.
Under the fresh wave of restrictions, all bars and restaurants across the country will also have to close by 6 p.m., he said.
“The stress on the national health system has reached worrying levels,” Conte said, the Financial Times reported.
Conte said the fresh restrictions are a better alternative to a national lockdown, which was imposed in March and lasted 10 weeks.
“Our aim is to protect health and the economy,” Conte said.
Italian officials said Saturday that new cases had climbed by 19,664 in 24 hours in what was a new daily record, the outlet reported.
“These are difficult days,” Health Minister Roberto Speranza said. “The curve of contagion is growing in the world. And in all Europe the wave is very high. We must react immediately and with determination if we want to avoid unsustainable numbers.”

ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported on Sunday that the Jaguars running back is not expected to return this season, “because of symptoms that he has suffered while battling COVID-19.”
Armstead was expected to take over the Jacksonville backfield after Leonard Fournette was shockingly cut during the offseason.
The 23-year-old was initially placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list (a new designation for 2020) in August, and again in September. He has been hospitalized twice and has experienced, “significant respiratory issues, and has been hit harder than some expected,” Schefter wrote.
Fortunately, Schefter added that Armstead “is expected to return next season at full strength, according to sources.”

CNN’s Jake Tapper noted that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines call for Pence to be quarantined for 14 days and questioned why he is still continuing to criss-cross the country campaigning.
“Actually he’s not just campaigning, he’s working. We saw a Middle East peace agreement with Sudan in the Oval Office that the President engaged in,” Meadows said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” referring to last week’s announcement that Sudan and Israel will normalize relations.
“And for anybody to suggest that the president has been out campaigning and not getting things done, all you have to do is look at the facts,” Meadows said.
He said Pence is actually considered an essential worker and will continue to make campaign appearances.
“I’m not saying he’s not campaigning. I’m saying that is only part of what he’s doing,” Meadows said of Trump. “As we look at that, essential personnel, whether it’s the vice president of the United States or anyone else, has to continue on.”
He said he talked to Pence and the vice president reassured him that he is taking precautions at the rallies after the aides, including chief of staff Marc Short and senior adviser Marty Obst, tested positive.
“I can tell you that what he’s doing is wearing a mask, socially distancing and when he goes up to speak he will take the mask off, put it back on,” he said.
Corey Lewandowski, an adviser to the Trump campaign, also said he was sure Pence was taking the necessary precautions – and compared them with those taken by Joe Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris.
“We have also seen Kamala Harris’ team come down with Covid and she took the necessary precautions,” Lewandowski said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press”.
Her campaign halted travel for four days after two of her staffers were diagnosed with the coronavirus."

The extra cash gives me a nice boost for the holidays. I’m worried employers won’t consider me due to my age, given the COVID situation. I know they can’t normally discriminate, but can they use that as an excuse not to hire me?
My mother-in-law is 88 and works for the same reason. She was furloughed due to COVID and recently offered her job back — remarkable on many levels. You are wondering if, since the scientists say older people are more at risk, employers can use that as an excuse to discriminate on the basis of age. It would be a novel rationale — that they are declining to hire you for your own safety. No matter how you slice it, that is an adverse employment decision based on age, and the law doesn’t allow it. Don’t let your age be a psychological obstacle for you. Just apply to every job that interests you with confidence and enthusiasm. Many employers actually prefer older seasonal workers, finding them more mature and responsible, so stay positive.
I’m good at what I do, but my job is focused on one thing, and I’m afraid I won’t have enough diversity in my attributes when looking for another job. How can I round out my skills?
Well, I bet that you are already good at more than one thing, but your employer hasn’t yet tapped into that. You might want to ask to take on more responsibility, even if they can’t offer you more money (although more moolah is always good). Or, volunteer for special projects where you can stretch a little and learn new skills or demonstrate what else you have to offer. Think of it as an investment in yourself. You might also consider going back to school part time to get an advanced degree, or take continuing education classes. Check with your employer about what training and development programs they offer. Lastly, if your employer can’t give you growth opportunities, look for a new job that will. That might not seem appealing in these uncertain times, but there’s no harm and risk in looking for a new job while you have one. That’s the best place to be.

648,Mark Meadows says ‘we’re not going to control’ COVID-19 pandemic,https://nypost.com/2020/10/25/wh-chief-of-staff-mark-meadows-says-we-wont-control-covid-19/,2020-10-25 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Sunday that the country is “not going to control the pandemic” — noting it is contagious like the flu and must be managed with therapeutics and vaccines.
“We’re not going to control the pandemic. We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigation efforts,” Meadows said during a contentious interview with Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“Why aren’t we going to get to control the pandemic?” Tapper asked.
“Because it is a contagious virus just like the flu,” Meadows responded, as the two went back and forth about President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence continuing to campaign after five members of Pence’s staff testing positive.
“Let me just say this is what we need to do is make sure that we have the proper mitigation factors — whether it’s therapies or vaccines or treatments — to make sure that people don’t die from this,” he said.
Mark Meadows: “We’re not going to control the pandemic, we are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigations.”

Meadows then went on to suggest that former Vice President Joe Biden wants to quarantine the country.
Tapper said, “nobody is saying that.”
“They are. Joe Biden is saying that. He says, lock everybody down, we’re going to have a dark winter,” Meadows said.
But Tapper countered that’s what health officials are warning will happen this winter as the number of cases surged in the Midwest.
Democrats quickly ripped Meadow’s comment Sunday.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has made the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic a main thrust of his campaign, said he was “stunned.”
“This wasn’t a slip by Meadows,” Biden said in a statement. “It was a candid acknowledgement of what President Trump’s strategy has clearly been from the beginning of this crisis: to wave the white flag of defeat and hope that by ignoring it, the virus would simply go away. It hasn’t, and it won’t.”
Gov. Andrew Cuomo, meanwhile, accused the administration of “surrender.”
“He said we can’t control the virus. That was a very telling statement, that he said that. … Flattening the curve is controlling the virus,” Cuomo said Sunday at a coronavirus briefing.
Cuomo said the White House had “capitulated” to the pandemic.
“They surrendered. … It was the great American surrender. Americans don’t surrender. And they didn’t even put up a fight. What we learned in New York is, we put up a fight,” he said.
“We can’t control the virus — Trump’s theory: pre-emptive capitulation. Don’t even try. Just surrender pre-emptively. President Trump, commander in chief. Get attacked by an enemy and pre-emptively capitulate,” the governor continued. “And now we have 217,000 people dead. They were wrong then, they’re wrong now.”
More than 222,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus, but fatality rates have sharply declined as treatments have improved."
649,NFL mulling Raiders punishment after Titans get $350K COVID-19 fine,https://nypost.com/2020/10/25/nfl-mulls-raiders-punishment-after-titans-get-350k-covid-19-fine/,2020-10-25 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
The NFL finally punished the Tennessee Titans after the team’s COVID-19 outbreak, and now the Las Vegas Raiders have the league’s full attention.
The Titans were slapped with a $350,000 fine for violating the NFL’s COVID-19 protocols following a joint review between the league and NFLPA, according to NFL Network, which reports the Raiders could face discipline after right tackle Trent Brown was found to not be consistently wearing his contact-tracing device.
Brown’s positive COVID-19 test during the week led to the rest of the Raiders’ starting offensive line being forced to sit out of practices. It was determined the entire offensive line gathered without face coverings during practice, per NFL Network.
It’s the latest in a string of Raiders incidents that likely has the NFL fuming, which could potentially lead to a harsher punishment than the Titans’. Head coach Jon Gruden was fined $100,000 for violating the league’s mask mandate after the Raiders’ Week 2 win against the Saints. The team was also fined $250,000 because of the violation, while it was also fined $50,000 for having an unauthorized person in its locker room after the Saints game.
Earlier this month, 10 Raiders players were fined after tight end Darren Waller hosted a charity event for his foundation during which players were not wearing masks. Waller was fined $30,000 while nine other players, including quarterback Derek Carr, were fined $15,000 each.
Tennessee’s fine came after the NFL and NFLPA found there were times masks weren’t being worn at the team’s facility. The team had 24 positive COVID-19 tests that led to schedule changes, including its Week 4 game against the Steelers being postponed to Week 7, and its Week 5 game against Buffalo being pushed to Tuesday of that week. The Titans escaped worse punishment that the NFL has threatened recently, which includes being stripped of draft picks and forfeits.
Meanwhile, video showed Giants stars Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley out Friday night without masks, but it’s not clear if they violated the NFL’s COVID-19 protocols. The two players, along with other teammates and friends, dined in a private room at a Manhattan restaurant before going to a bar that is closed to the public."
650,Florida nurse claims doctor intentionally infected her with COVID-19,https://nypost.com/2020/10/25/nurse-claims-doctor-infected-her-with-covid-19-on-purpose/,2020-10-25 00:00:00,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.
A Florida nurse has claimed a doctor intentionally infected her with COVID-19 after she complained about the lack of personal protective equipment in the office.
Venise Jean-Baptiste has filed a lawsuit alleging that her boss, Dr. Joseph Piperato, denied her PPE and showed up to work with symptoms of the virus after going in March to a dance festival in Miami Beach, news station WSVN reported.
“He was coughing more, and you could tell he may be sick,” Jean-Baptiste told the outlet.
She said she had been hounding him before he fell ill to get the office at the Project Access Foundation to follow COVID-19 guidelines.
“We didn’t have N95 masks,” Jean-Baptiste said. “The masks that we did have, they wouldn’t allow us to wear for every single patient.”
Jean-Baptiste said they were both walking in the hallway when she suggested the visibly-sick doctor get tested for the virus.
But that’s when she said her boss stopped, turned and coughed in her direction.
“He just went ‘Ahhh,’ and he said, ‘Well, if I have it, now you have it, too. Now, leave me alone,’” Jean-Baptist said.
She said days later she and her 2-year-old son, Abel, began experiencing symptoms, forcing her to spend more than a week in the hospital fighting the virus.
“I called my family and said, ‘This is what I want you to do with my son … just in case if I don’t make it, because I don’t think I’m going to make it,'” Jean-Baptiste told news station WPLG.
Jean-Baptiste has since recovered but is seeking damages for her health, her medical bills and her recovery.
The Project Access Foundation has denied the allegations, saying they were following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention including symptom checks and providing PPE, the outlets reported.
“The allegations set forth in the complaint are unfounded and will be aggressively defended,” the nonprofit organization said."
